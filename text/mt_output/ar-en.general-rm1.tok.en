you didn't start three minutes yet, did you?
no, you can't start three minutes.
start the start of three minutes. that's not fair.
allison hunt: oh, my god, it's hard here.
I mean, I'm nervous enough.
but I'm not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.
five weeks ago, I had surgery to replace the whole hip.
do you know that surgery?
unless you're david bolensky, it'll be all the truth and beauty.
of course, david, it's not your hip, it's the truth and beauty.
anyway, I realized something interesting about this attitude, so he called me chris to tell you about him.
but first, I'll tell you two things about me.
just two things.
I'm canadian, and I'm the youngest of my seven brothers.
in canada, we have an excellent health care system.
and that means we get that surgery for free.
and being the younger sister, I was never in the front of class, okay?
the hip's been killing me for years.
and I finally went to a doctor, and the treatment is free.
and I told me to the bone surgeon, which was also free of charge.
and I was finally able to meet him after 10 months of waiting - almost a year.
that's what you get for free care.
I met the surgeon, took some x-rays free of charge, and I got pretty hard on them, you know, wanting to tell them that the hip was in a bad condition, and in fact I work in marketing.
and allison said, " we'll fix you. "
I'll replace the hip. it'll take 18 months of waiting.
another 18 months.
I've waited ten months and wait for another 18 months.
I've waited so much to think about it in ted's conferences.
I can't replace your hip detail for ted's conference.
I can't replace the hip for ted glopal in africa,
I can't replace the hip for ted 2008.
I'm gonna stay with this joint that hurts me.
I left his office and I was walking in the hospital, and here I am.
that little sister has to step in the line.
that's it.
can I tell you how it wasn't canadian thinking?
we don't think that way.
we're not even talking about it.
actually, when we travel outside, here's the way we recognize the canadians like us.
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
oh, are you from canada?
great!
so, suddenly I wasn't negative to give up on my list.
some of those 70 years of age want to replace the hip, so he can play golf or tell the garden.
no, no, I was in the front of the class this time.
so now I walk in the lobby, and, of course, it hurts, because of your hip, and I needed a sign.
and I saw a sign.
on a window for a small gift shop in the hospital that says " wanted volunteers. "
all right, they kissed me right away.
they didn't check my data, nothing of historical stuff, nothing.
they were very needed to volunteer because the average age at the gift shop in the hospital was 75.
yeah, they need young blood.
then, I had a fancy blue jacket, and I had proof of identity.
I worked alone.
I work every friday morning at the gift shop.
while I sell candy to the hospital staff, I'm asking you, what do you do?
 I'll be replaced by a hip and a hip in 18 months. 
when the pain goes down, it'll feel great. "
all the staff at the hospital have become a brave little volunteer.
it was my next date with the surgeon, accidentally, after the shift at the gift shop.
so it's natural that I have my jacket and my hoodie.
and they got them on the chair at the doctor's office.
and you know, when he came in, saw the jacket and the identity.
he set me a date for surgery several weeks later, and I wrote a lot of static medicine.
now, in the street, it was actually that my volunteering actually made me at the front of the class.
and you know, I'm not embarrassed about this.
two reasons:
first of all, because I'm gonna take good care of that joint.
and also because I'm going to continue volunteering, which brings me in the truth - to this wonderful idea.
even when canadians take over the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.
I want to ask you to raise your hands and wave it back like I do.
you can simulate what you're watching.
you can program hundreds of muscle in your hands.
soon, you'll be able to see what's inside your brains and software, control hundreds of areas for the brain you see there.
I'll tell you about that technology.
people wanted to see what's inside the human brain, the human brain, for thousands of years.
well, he just got out of search labs. just the possibility of doing that.
it's hard to imagine people. it's very hard.
you had to take a spaceship, shrink its size, then pump it to the bloody cycle.
it was so dangerous that you might be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.
but now, we have real technology to do that.
we'll fly into my partner's brain, peter.
we'll do it without spreading with an mri.
we don't have to inject anything. we don't need anything.
we'll be able to fly in peter's brain autopsy - literally flying in his body, but more importantly, we can see what's inside his brain.
when peter moves his hand, that yellow dot you see is the front of peter's brain.
and here you see it with the electric pole that controls the robot's hand, this brain imaging and the scanners can offer what's inside the brain.
new is that this operation took days or months of analysis.
we've narrowed it across technology to parts of the second that peter managed to see inside his brain, as long as he's inside the scanner.
he can see 65,000 points of activation every second.
if he can see patterns inside his brain, he can learn how to control it.
there were three ways to try to influence the brain: touching the couch, processed pills, and knife.
this is the fourth alternative that will soon be available.
we all know that when we make ideas, they make deep channels in our brothers and brains.
if you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.
but if you're in constant pain in six months or six years, this is because the circles that produce pain are no longer helping you.
if you look into how the brain works that produces that pain, you can form a three-dimensional model and control the brain processing process in a direct time, and then you can choose the areas that produce pain.
if you put your hands in the back and get your muscle in the back.
now imagine that you're soon to see what's inside your brains and choose the brain zone that does the same thing.
what you see here is, we picked the brain tracks for a patient of chronic pain.
it might blow you up, but you literally read this guy's brain in a direct time.
they watch the way their brains are activated and they control the tracks that produce pain.
they learn to practice this system that shoots their opiates.
and as they do this, the north is above the show, and this is linked to their cerebral activity for their security.
when they control their brain, they control their pain.
this is technology that is investigating, but in laboratory experiments, we see a decrease of 44 to 64 per cent in chronic pain patients.
you can just do this to yourself.
I saw what's inside my brain. you can, too, soon.
when you can, what do you want to control?
you'll be able to consider all sides that made your personality, all your experience.
these are some areas we're working on today that time is not allowed to enter into detail.
but I want to leave you with the big question.
you are the first generations to be able to break into this by using this technology, human brain and brain.
where are we gonna use it?
he visited me, almost a year ago, just over a year ago, from a very important official of the ministry of defence.
he came to meet me and said, " 1,600 boys who sent them out back without a complete arm at least.
the arm full of shoulder is fired from shoulder.
we do, roughly, the same thing that we have taken since the civil war, penis and hook.
they deserve more than that. "
 I want you to give me something that we can put to those boys who can pick a pill or grapes from the table, they can put them inside the mouth without destroying either of them, and they can be discriminated against,  he said.
in the sense, transport, brought in touch with touch.
this explanation was completed and I await 300 pounds < 136.2 kg of the proposed paper, and he said, " that's what I want from you. "
I told him, " listen, you're delirious. this technology isn't available right now. "
it can not be implemented.
not in the form of a portfolio of human hands equivalent to 21 degrees, from the highest shoulder to the bottom of your fingertips. "
he said, " almost 24 kids of those 1,600 came back without both arms. "
do you think losing one hand is bad?
this is not a match for the loss of both hands. "
I work all day, every night and weekend full of things like, let's save water and energy for the world, and let's know all the boys, and this last, chris, the platform coordinator, I'm not gonna need another mission.
and I didn't think I'd think about those boys, my hands are out of hands.
and he tells me: " we've done some tasks around the states.
we have some skilled neuroscientists and others. "
I said, " I'll do a field tour, and I'll check what you got. "
the next month I visited several places, here and there, around the states, you don't get the best I can.
I went to washington, I met those officials, and I said, " I did what you asked me to do.
I still think you're delirious, but it's not that much I assumed. "
I built a task force, over 13 months ago, collected about 20 experts.
we said, we'll set up a device that does what he wants.
we have 14 degrees out of 21 ; those are not needed for the last two fingers.
we brought this thing together.
two weeks ago, we carried him to walter reed, who had bad luck that the news was on his way to a lot of these days.
we offered him a bunch of people.
one of the people who described himself as lucky, because he lost his left arm, and he's an eeman.
he sat at the table with seven eight of those other people.
he said he was lucky, because he kept his right arm, then pushed himself back away from the table.
those boys have the qualities and behaviour that are unbelievable.
so I'm gonna offer you now, without a skin touch on it, a show from 30 seconds, and I'll be sealed.
but let it be known: what you are about to watch has done enough to fit into a middle-sized female, so we can put it on any disabled person.
he's gonna be put inside something we use in ct imaging devices and the magnetography of any hand of their right hand to make silicon flexible, and then he's wearing it and his divorce from three dimensions, a matching copy of their other thesis.
so you will not see all the great work of that flexible series of 14 mechanical engines, each of which has the special ability to feel heat and pressure.
and he also has an air conditioner to catch him, and so the more he's under the pressure of pregnancy, the more she gets stuck.
they're out of pressure. he's coming back as he was.
I'll show you someone who leads two simple things using this that we offered in washington.
look, the fingers are taken. the thumb goes out.
this weighs 6.9 pounds < 3.1326kg >.
he's going to run his nose.
he's 14 degrees.
now he's going to pick up a pen with his face and the fly.
now he's gonna put that down, pick up a piece of paper, all the grades on his hand and his wrist, and read it.
< < applause > >, I'm an investor. I'm a rocket. I'm a rocket.
I love the pictures, I love the missiles, I'll talk to you about an inflatable hobby and show you some pictures that you picked up over the years with kids like these, kids, hoping they're gonna grow up to love the missiles, and maybe they become another richard parson.
my son designed a rocket-propelled grenade, a golf ball, I thought it was an exciting experiment in the missile science principles and flew into the arrow.
soda and vinegar.
night shots are beautiful. we hacked the big room and trained the milky way.
two phases, rockets, rockets with internal computer cameras to write off a missile flight with a plane flying back into the ground.
I used rose-toxin to simulate flights to see if it would be the speed of sound or not, and then release it with internal computers to check it out.
but to actually launch big rockets, we go to the middle of the desert desert desert, where serious things happen.
the boys become bigger, more rockets, and they use engines that literally use it on cruise missile stimulation.
they cut the abdomen and leave photographers in gold to see the scene.
these missiles use experimental engines like nitrous oxide.
they use solid fuel often.
it's a strange kind of love.
we have the location of roketemicks.com on it, if you want to know more about this.
macricks, we had to call him rocky mavricks.
it was great, he went to 100,000 feet, but he couldn't actually go 11 feet inside the solid mud and cook the fort in the mud, we had to get him out.
the missiles check it out, usually if you put a lot of fuel in it.
that was a race.
at night, you can see what happened in a second in the day. we call it wild sharks.
sometimes they explode in front of your eyes, or fall faster than the sound.
big enough to take this shot, do what I usually do to go away where there's no other bystanders.
and if we run the video, I'll show you the effort to take this dream.
a video: yes, beautiful.
this is rare.
they shout to play, shout to play, sounds like shit.
here they found out that everything went down.
sounds like he's gone crazy.
I'll shut up now.
no, no, no.
up, up, up, up.
this is me there, take pictures all the way.
usually the mistakes happen.
some are watching this event of alarm like nascar, things colliding, crushing the parachute, and it's falling like this last week.
this rocket came up, spread the sound, ripped the tail into the sky, usually a piece of burnt metal.
these things will fall out of the sky all weekend, firing rockets, after a rocket, after a rocket.
it's a rhythm you can't imagine.
and usually I'm trying to pick up the shit, and it's a challenge to film when these things happen in part of the second.
why do they do it? it's like jane from alabama leads there with a rocket built, he's got x-ray sensors and video cameras with electronics, works to 100, 000 feet, leaves the atmosphere, and sees the exact blue line from space.
it's this picture that takes the breath of success, of course - which is motivated by our motivation and stimulation of children to follow up and understand rocket science to understand the importance of physics and mathematics and many ways of exploring the unknown ocean in the unknown ocean.
thank you.
when we do nothing to avoid him in the next 40 years, we're facing a neurological epidemic at the world level.
delightful servers.
on this map, all countries blue have surpassed more than 20 % of their population of 65.
this is the world we live in.
and this is the world where your sons will live.
over 12,000 years, the distribution rate in humans seems to be electricity, with the biggest at the top.
and I'm starting to dress up.
by 2050, it'll become my column and start reflection.
here's explaining what's going on.
the average age has doubled since 1840 and is currently over five hours a day.
that's not a good thing, because the risk of a nasal disease after the age of 65, or the seismic paralysis of asia, is not a good thing.
by 2050, about 32 million people in the united states will be over 80, and until we do something in this regard, half of them will have an aneurysm and three million other people who will be infected with seismic paralysis.
currently, these diseases and other neurological diseases - which we don't have a cure or a cat - cost about one third of a trillion dollars a year.
and it'll be more than trillion by 2050.
the oblivious disease begins when it changes protein, which should be properly developed to be designed for some kind of crazy system.
one of the directions we're working on, trying to design medicine that works in a way like the tape of the tape to keep protein in its right shape.
which would get him out of the composition, which seems to be destroying a large part of the brain when you're interwoven.
it's interesting, some other neurological diseases that affect different parts of the brain also show a protein intersect, and this suggests that the orientation might seem to be a year and can be used to treat a lot of neurological diseases, not just oblivious.
there's also a cancer relationship here, that people with neurological diseases have low numbers of cancer types.
and this is a bond that most people aren't taught now, and we have been impressed by him.
most of the most creative work on this side is supported by special contributions.
and there's a huge area of private sector assistance here because I'm afraid the government dropped the ball on a lot of these.
and while we're waiting for these things to happen, that's what you can do to yourself:
if you want to reduce the risk of caffeine paralysis, it's not even anyone who knows why.
head injuries are bad for you.
and bird flu is also not a good idea.
well, we find that fish oil has a chance to reduce the injury to alzheimer's disease.
and you should keep a low blood pressure, because the chronic blood pressure is the biggest factor of amnesia.
it's also one of the biggest risk factors for the eye of the eye, and it's like an aneurysm of the eye.
and, of course, when you come to realize the words of the saying, use it or lose it, we find it applicable if you want to be a psychopath.
but hey, you listen to me.
so you absorbed this side.
one last thing, you wish for people like me, okay?
because the clock is ticking for us all.
thank you.
good morning.
let's look for a minute to the greatest symbol, leonardo da vinci.
we all know his wonderful work, his paintings, his paintings, his inventions, and his writings.
but we don't know his face.
thousands of books wrote about it, but there's a disagreement, and the difference is continuing.
even this known revolution is unacceptable to a lot of art historians.
what do you think?
is that the face of leonardo da vinci or not?
let's find out.
leonardo man drew everything around him.
the drawing of people, plants, animals, scenery, buildings, water, everything.
but faces?
I find that hard to believe.
his wrists have painted faces. my words see her here, a full face or three quarters.
so it must be a passion like leonardo. he must have drawn personal pictures from time to time.
so let's try to find her.
I think if we secure all his work, and we're looking for personal pictures, we'll find his face looking at us.
so, all of his work, over 700, examined pictures of a male.
there are about 120. see them here.
personal picture?
well, that's why we just saw, a full face or three quarters.
so we can rule out all sides.
and it should be detailed.
so we can rule out the horrendous pictures.
and we know from his storm that leonardo was very handsome, and he was beautiful.
so we can rule out the slaughter or the lizard.
(laughs) and look at what's happening - only three candidates apply to the specifications.
and here they are.
and indeed, the old man is here as the famous drawing of homo vidrovesance.
and finally, the only painting that leonardo drew to a christian man.
before we get deeper in these faces, I have to explain my true talk about them.
I've painted more than 1,100 pictures of newspapers, over 300-30 years. I'm only 30 years.
(laughs) but there are 1,100, very few artists have made this number of faces.
so I know a little bit about facial analysis.
all right, let's look at these three pictures.
hold your seats, because if we close these faces, they noticed that all of them have the same broad front, the horizontal eyebrows of the long nose, the curly lips, and the little chin.
I didn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.
there's no reason to look at these pictures.
all we've done is search for pictures that have the characteristics of personal pictures, and look, they're very similar.
now, did you draw the right order?
the guy should come first.
and as you can see here from the years of drawing, it's already too.
I drew in the right order.
what's the age of leonardo then?
he was 33, 38 and 63 when she drew this.
so we have three pictures, possible for the same person at the same age as leonardo.
but do we know it's him, not someone else?
okay, we need a reference.
and this is the only acceptable picture of leonardo.
it's a statue of verchio, from david where leonardo stood as a 15-year-old boy.
now, if we compare the statue to the musician, you see the same features again.
the statue is the reference, and it links leonardo's identity to these three faces.
ladies and gentlemen, this story hasn't been published yet.
it's fitting that you hear here in ted and learn this first.
the symbol symbol finally has a face.
this is him. leonardo da vinci.
(applause) the use of seismic leads in south africa dates back to hundreds of years.
but the modernity actually brought communications and all the new materials in the form of phone connections.
rural-to-city migration is designed to find new raw materials that are starting to find what is hard to come with natural herbs.
so, here you can see the change of use - it started using contemporary materials.
the history of these pieces is due from the 1940s to the end of the 1950s.
in the 1990s, my interest and passion in changing art forms led me to a new form that came from a population camp outside durban.
I have the opportunity to start working with this community at that time, and the development, the reality and their guidance in the context of the design, has been initiated within the framework of design.
the project grew from 5 to 50 in a year.
soon they went out the scrap yard, what they could do, so we asked for help from a thread maker, not just to provide us with the materials and the virgin, but to produce planets on our side.
at the same time, I was thinking, well, there's a lot of possibilities here to produce contemporary goods away from ethnicity, and more contemporary.
so I put a wide range of waves around the mass of products that usually have a much higher income in the decor market that can be exported and can serve our local market.
we started experimenting, as you can see, for the forms of stereotypes, sizes are very necessary and our intimate project is successful, and it still works 12 years ago, and the trade shops and donna karan, which is kind of a great job.
this is our group, the major hobbies.
they come every week to durban.
they have bank accounts.
they all came back to the countryside they came from.
it's a weekly shift of production.
this is the original society I showed you a picture of.
and this has also been updated now, and he provides jobs for 300 monsters.
and what's left to tell the others
thank you very much.
applause for those who know me know how ambitious I am to open space boundaries.
so when I had the chance to introduce the most prominent expert in the world on gravity, I almost didn't believe it.
and I want to tell you that story.
I met him for the first time through the arkin competition.
it's a contest we're organizing, and it's the second x, for the first team that can deliver a hundred thousand human beings within ten days.
we have a team called " 100 genome, " and he's got a hundred people, we'll show their genes as part of the contest.
craig venter, head of that project.
and I met professor hawking and told me that his dream was to go to space.
and I told him I can't take you there, but I can take you back to no weight.
 sure, yeah,  he said.
the only way to try the gravitational experiment on earth is the equivalent flight of barbolick.
you take a plane flying up and get no weight for five seconds,
then you go down again and you get your weight up.
and do it over and over again.
it could get eight to ten minutes without weight. this is the way nasa trained astronauts for a long time.
we have to do this.
it took us 11 years to get ready for implementation.
and let us know that we'll take steven hawking to fly.
there was a government agency and a company operator who tells us, " you're crazy, don't do this, you're gonna kill the man. "
(laughs) he wanted to go.
we worked hard to get all the ears.
six months later we went to the kennedy space center.
we held a press conference and announced our goal to do a " burpola " once - and so we believe in him five and twenty seconds without attraction.
and if the experiment went well, we could have done three burbles.
ask him why he wants to get up on this trip,
and his response raised my feelings so much.
 life in the earth is at an increasing risk of disaster,  he said.
I think mankind doesn't have a future if you don't go into space.
I would therefore like to encourage public interest in space. "
we took him to the kennedy space center inside nasa into the back of the attractive plane.
we had about 20 people donated - we got them a hundred and fifty thousand dollars from donations to charitable associations for children.
and they're the ones who bring ted conference with us here.
we got a complete emergency room.
and we had four emergency doctors and two nurses on the plane.
we've been watching the amount of oxygen in his blood, his heart rate and his blood pressure.
and god knows you don't want to hurt this world expert.
we took off from the shuttle landing facility where he's taking off and down the shuttle.
my colleague peron lectenberg and I put him in a very careful condition.
and when he was in that case, we left him to try the truth.
and after that first burpoole, doctors said his health was good, and he was smiling, so let's go again.
and we did braboole again.
(laughs) (applause) and third
and now we have a greeting for sir isaac newton, because professor hawking is leading the same section in the bridge, which is headed by isaac newton.
we did a fourth, fifth and sixth trip.
(laughs) and seven and eight.
and this guy doesn't look like a five-year-old disabled man.
(laughs) he was so happy.
we live on a precious gem and in our lives we will move from this planet.
please join us in this epic adventure.
thank you very much.
(applause) it's amazing, when you meet a head of state and say, " what's the most valuable resource for you? "
then when you tell him the kids, he quickly agreed with you.
(video): today we travel with colombian minister of defence, army commander and police commander, and we will transfer 650 laptop computers today to children who have no television or phone and were in an isolated society from the rest of the
the importance of sending computers to this area is to connect children who otherwise will be isolated due to revolutionary gangs, which have been launched 40 years ago as a political movement and turned into a drug movement.
there are a billion children in the world, 50 per cent of whom have no electricity in the house or school.
in some countries, let me select afghanistan - 75 per cent of young girls do not go to school.
and I don't mean they leave school in third or fourth grade.
so three years ago since I talked to ted and offered the prototype, it turned out to be a real laptop.
we have half a million computers today in the hands of children.
we have about a quarter of a million on the way to these and other children, and then there's another quarter of a million requested at this moment.
so, with rough numbers, there's a million laptop computers.
it's less than I expected - three to 10 million, but it's still a huge number.
in columbia, we have some 3 thousand laptop computers.
the minister of defence is the person we work with, not the minister of education, because he is considered as a strategic defence issue in the sense of the liberation of these areas, where people have lived, if they are, for 40 years of bombings, kidnapping and assassinations, as is the case.
all of a sudden, children have been connected to portable computers.
they've outlived.
change of course is enormous, because it's not just opening the door, but he opened the door to the rest of the world.
if yes, they're pointing roads, yeah, they're setting up phones, yeah, there'll be a tv.
however, children aged 6 to 12 explore the internet in spanish and local languages, if children are established with access to information with a window to the rest of the world.
in the past, they were isolated.
in the rest of the countries, the minister of finance would be seen as an engine for economic growth.
that engine will witness the results within 20 years.
that won't happen, you know, in a year, but it's an important change, economic and cultural change that happens across children.
31 states in the survey, and in the case of uruguay, half of the children have already received, and by mid-2009, every child in uruguay will have a laptop - a small green laptop.
now what are the results?
some of the results in each state include the teachers' saying that they did not like teaching so much, and to read the establishment of the evaluation of other people - not us - as a waste.
the most important thing we see is to teach children to their parents.
they have portable computers. they take it home.
thus, I met with three children from schools, who were moving all day to bogota, one of the three children who brought her mother.
the reason she brought her to her mother was that this six-year-old child knew her mother how she read and wrote.
her mother didn't go to primary school.
this is like a transformation, and this wonderful example of children becomes agents of change.
so now, in conclusion, people say, now why are they loaded?
she's a luxury.
the reason for the mobile computers is that the target is education, not a laptop.
this is an educational project, not a laptop project.
and then, just think - they can get, let's say, 100 books.
in the village, you have 100 laptop computers, each of which each has a different set of 100 books, and suddenly the village has 10 thousand books.
we didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.
sometimes school under the tree, or in many cases, only five teachers study, if we need a collaborative model of learning, not only to build more schools and to train more teachers, what you should do anyway.
if we do again, " give one, take one. "
last year, we did a " one, " take one, and it caused 100,000 laptop computers so we could offer them free.
and being a free laptop, we can go to countries that can't pay at all.
that's what we did. we went to haiti, and we went to rwanda, afghanistan, ethiopia, mongolia.
places that are not markets, we put seeds for saturation basics, linkage, low ages, and galactic.
and then we can actually make bigger numbers.
if they think about it that way, think about it.
and think of the laptop as a vaccine.
you don't get a few kids.
you're giving all the children in the area.
so, I thought I was, " I'll talk about death. "
looks like he's the one today.
actually, it's not about death.
although it's inevitable, terrible, but what I want to talk about is, in fact, I'm intrigued by the legacy of people after their death.
that's what I want to talk about.
if art bochwald leaves his priest in the video that came back shortly after he died, he says, " hi, I art bochwald, and I just died. "
and mike, what I met in the galas, the trip I won in ted's, leaves notes online where he dated his flight with cancer.
my father left me a legacy from his handwriting through letters and notes.
in the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled his note with his mind about me.
he wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and some nice advice to develop, citing certain incidents, and carrying a mirror for my life.
and after he died, I realized nobody wrote me anymore.
the writing of the hand is an art that disappears.
everybody's in the mail, thinking about printing, but why are we sacrificed to the old habits for the new?
why can't we write letters and exchange e-mails in our lives?
it's been times I wanted to trade all those years I've been busy with my father and chat with him, and I wanted to trade all those years with one.
but it's too late.
but when I get the messages out, read it and the papers that touch his hands, I feel like I'm connected to him.
so maybe we'll need to leave our children a valuable inheritance, not a fortune money.
- value of a personal touch. - a book of signatures, a search letter.
if there is a small number of people who have been involved, and buy a beautiful paper - john, it's a pretty good message for someone who loves him, the fact that we might start a revolution where our children might go to classes to study the art of the line.
so what do I plan on him for my son?
gather the signatures, those you are in the knowledge of the public and the hard drives, as well, tracy.
I plan to spread my own diary.
when I watched my father's body, the flames sat near the incinerator of his funeral and wrote.
I had no idea how to do it, but I'm committed to translating his thoughts and thoughts into a book, leaving that book for my son.
I want to hide a little quote from what I wrote in my father's funeral.
and for a language specialist, please watch the rules because I haven't seen her in the past 10 years.
I'll give it to you for the first time here.
a picture in a box, ash in a bottle, unlimited energy in a bottle, force me to accept, in fact, force me to accept that I've become mature.
I hear you, and I know you want me to be strong, but now, I'm attracted to the bottom, trapped, and emotionally suffocated with this fancy water, so you're trying to get out on a solid basis again, just like you taught me.
your encouraging message to me in my dormitory with elias amakI and took me to the integrity of the straight, to live again and love again. "
thank you.
we'll talk today about complementing the annoying truth.
it's time again to talk about the annoying truth, the truth that everybody cares about, but nobody wants to talk about it.
and someone needs to start, and I've decided to do it.
if you're afraid of global warming, wait till you learn something about the local temperature.
we'll talk about the local temperature rise today.
an important health message: codification may be a danger to your health, especially if you're a reminder.
this letter was presented as a public service.
the codification affects your condition.
this is the status of ladies who don't care, and this is the position of ladies who live.
(laughs) this is a normal position for a man sitting, squatting for ventilation purposes.
and this is a normal position for a man standing, and I think this picture inspired chris to put me in a artisanal thinking session.
this is the position of a man who sits, and the result is, " for a better rest, men sit naturally with their legs away from some of them, unlike women, when they are busy with the laptop.
while they are taking less normal conditions to balance their legs, which has led to a marked increase in the body's heat between their traps, this is the issue of domestic warming.
this is a very serious newspaper, the times english newspaper - very serious. this - (laughs) - gentlemen and ladies, be serious.
this is a very serious search. you have to read a line.
and be careful, your genes are in danger.
are the geek gonna be endangered creatures?
the truth: population growth in the country with more mobile computers - (laughs) I want hans roslin to give me a chart.
(applause) the fun of the world warmth.
(laughs) but let's keep things in fit.
first, you can use natural ventilation.
you have to keep quiet with the proper clothes.
- you have to take care of your condition. - that's not true.
can you get a minute and a half of chris for me, because I have a video and I have to introduce you to you.
this is the right situation.
another benefit for wireless networks, we learned yesterday about the benefits of wireless networks.
radio networks allow us to avoid treatment. there are some improvements in the protection standards that I want to share with you, and I want, in a minute, to thank philips for help.
this is a study published in 1986, but it's still true.
the temperature of the steward reflects the temperature of the testicular temperature, and it can shave it with a shave.
by the way, I have to admit, my english isn't good, I didn't know what the coffin was.
I'm guessing the gathering is the coffin, like the center and the media.
digital coffin, digital media.
and just last year, I knew I was the owner of a proud coffin.
(laughs) this search has been postponed by the u.s. government, so you can see the tax guy works for good purposes.
video: a man: this is phillips in boddy, a comfortable design to put safe and easy to shave that baby hair, and a curly hair that doesn't fit you (whistle), as well as places that are hard to reach down from a whistle, whistle. once you use bodie krom, the world seems different.
and also, whistle, these days, with a hair free back, the engineer's shoulders and the extra phobia in whistle, well, let's just say that life has become so warm.
yoshi vardy: this was one of the popular advertising in the past year, known as the philatelic championship. let's clap for phelps - (applause) - this gesture for mankind.
that's it - I didn't touch it, that's original.
the laptop is used to solve the problem of growing the population, and if anything fails, there are some secondary uses.
and then at the next ted conference, if you invite me, it'll be about why we don't have to put our mobile phones in our pockets.
this is what young people say from modern generations.
(applause) I just wanted to show you that I don't just wake up, but I'm also applied.
(laughs) 4 a.m.
(laughs) you can't use this picture.
(applause) now, I have some little gifts for ted, this is bodie krom for philip, one of our leaders.
(applause) anyone else who feels the threat, anyone who really needs it?
(laughs) any lady, any lady? thank you so much.
in his opening address, barack obama appealed to each of us to make every effort while we seek to save ourselves from this current economic crisis.
but what did we call it?
- he didn't pick up for lucky. - my footsteps didn't ask us to go shopping.
he did not say, " trust in us and in your country. "
invested, invested, invested.
but instead, he asked us to leave those heroic acts.
and we appealed to us to go back to the virtue.
and the virtue is an old word.
and it seems unsettled in a modern environment like that environment.
besides, he might wonder some fans: what's the meaning of the word actually?
let's start by mentioning the example:
what you see in front of you right now on screen is the job description for a cleaning agent of a hospital.
all the items mentioned do not be considered unusual.
it's those things that we can expect: the floors and their treasure, dump the trash, the tanks.
a little bit of the number of items, but we won't be surprised to see it.
but the only thing I want you to notice about these items is that although it is a very long list, it does not contain at least one thing about other people.
not one item
the position of the cleaning agent can lead to a very morgue as they perform in a hospital.
however, when some psychologists interviewed a group of hospital guards to identify what they believed to be their job, they met mike, who told them how he stopped scanning the floor because mr. jones was doing some exercises away from his bed, trying to strengthen his body, rising slowly and slowly during the hall.
charlene told them how she ignored her supervisor and she didn't clean up the guest room because some family members were in the room all day, and every day and every day, they were a little overwhelmed at this time.
then luke who cleaned the floor twice a day in a guy's room was a coma because the father of this boy who kept watching his son for six months never saw luke clean it first, and the father was angry for that reason.
such behaviour is from guards, professionals and nurses, and if we have some luck, the doctors will make people feel better, improve a reality of patient care and help hospitals work well.
not all the hospital workers are on this one, of course.
but there are those who believe that these types of humanitarian interactions include compassion, care and empathy as an essential part of the job.
however, their job descriptions did not include one word for other persons.
these guards have moral will to deal with others well.
as well as their moral skill to know what it means to " do what is right. "
aristotle told us that " real wisdom " is a mixture of moral will and moral skill.
the wise person knows when and how to apply a rule that each rule is an exception, and hospital workers have defined when they are overlooked in the service of other objectives.
and the wise person knows how to improvise, like luke did when he rewiped the floor.
the real problems of the world are often vague and unclear, and the context surrounding them has always changed.
and the wise person like a jazz player reads from the note, but he's hovering around her, innocents is a mixture of hate in line with the situation and the audience.
a wise person can employ these moral skills to serve the harsh goals ;
to serve others, not to manipulate others.
in the end, the most important thing is that the wise person is not born, but it is made.
the wisdom depends on experience, not just any experience,
you need time to know who you're serving.
you also need permission to allow you to improvise, test new things, and sometimes fail until you learn from your mistakes.
and you need some wise teachers to honor you.
and when you ask the workers who did those behaviors I explained about how hard you know their job, they tell you that she needed a lot of experience.
and they don't care about the floors of the floors or how to dump garbage boxes.
but they mean experience in caring for others.
and for tid, genius is widespread.
that's scary.
beautiful you don't need to be a genius until you're wise.
but the bad is that without wisdom, the genius alone is not enough.
and you and others are in trouble, like the possibility of anything else.
(applause) and I now hope that we all have realized this.
and there's a sense of that, but let me cut you a short story.
it's a story about lemon juice.
there was a seven-year-old father and son watching tigger detroit in the park.
the son asked his father for lemon juice and the father went to the corner of food and drinks for his purchase.
and all they got was lemonade, mike hard, which had 5 % alcohol.
although the father was university, he had no idea that lemon had alcohol.
get him.
the child began to drink lemon, a security officer who called the police, who contacted the police, which in turn called an ambulance that was rushed to the park and the boy was quickly taken to the hospital.
the emergency room confirmed that the boy's blood was free of alcohol.
they were willing to release the child.
but not so fast.
the children's welfare protection agency in wwin province refused to release the child.
the child was sent home for three days.
is that after that the baby can go home?
well, the judge said yes, provided that the father leaves the house and lives in any hotel.
two weeks later, I am pleased to tell you, family reunification has been made.
 we hate doing this, but we have actions to be followed,  the child protection agency and the ambulance protection agency, as well as the judge, said the same thing: " we hate doing this. "
how can such things happen?
he wondered here scott simon, who told us this story across national radio, saying, " rules and procedures may be silly, but they provide you to think. "
as a result of the right, the rules often impose the rules because of the disqualification of former officials and the fact that children are returning to those who hurt them.
indeed.
when things get worse, which is really happening, we go to two tools to deal with it.
the first we're trying to reach is the rules.
better rules, lots of them.
the second is incentives.
better incentives, lots of them, too.
but what else do we have, after all?
we can, of course, see this as a reaction to the current financial crisis.
organization, organization, organization.
modification of incentives, modification of incentives, modification of incentives
the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are sufficient to do the job.
what rule can you put into the hospital cleaning workers to do what they did?
and will you give them a reward for being emotional?
this is an antipsychotic in his face.
in fact, when we are heading more and more rules, rules and incentives can make things better in the short term, but create what is called earthquakes that make things worse in the long run.
moral skill is weakened when overreliance on the rules prevents us from the opportunity to improvise and learn what we improvise.
the moral will is to continue to maintain the incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing.
without the intention, by invoking rules and incentives, we declare war on wisdom.
let me give you a few examples, the first on the rules and the war on moral skill.
one of them is a lemon juice story.
the second example, which undoubtedly would be more familiar to you, about the nature of modern american education: I mean the stereotype curriculum.
this is an example of a nursery in chicago,
reading and enjoying language literature and words that begin with the " b " bath.
75 elements are listed in this text and a 25-page photographer book is taught.
all over chicago, in every classroom, in every nursery in the city, every single teacher says the same as the same day.
we know why these stereotypes exist.
we don't trust those teachers enough to call them free.
these texts serve as disaster insurance documents,
indeed, it is preventing disasters.
but what you're putting in for that is usual.
(applause) don't misunderstand me. we need the rules!
the jazz player needs a musical note, most of them need some notes on the sheet sheet.
god knows we need more rules for banks,
but the very many rules prevent the farmer from improvising.
as a result, they lose their talents, and worse, they may be able to play quite well.
now, what about the incentives?
she seems more amazing.
if I give you one reason to do something and then give you two reasons to do the same thing, it makes sense that there are definitely two better reasons for one reason and then you'll probably do this thing.
don't you?
okay, but it's not always that way.
we seem to be a contradiction between the two pillars of action rather than mutually reinforcing, which makes one not inclined to do so.
I'm going to give you one more example, because we're running out of time.
in switzerland, about 15 years ago, they were trying to decide where they reside in a warehouse of nuclear waste.
a popular referendum was prepared.
some psychologists have spread and have looked forward to the views of citizens who are aware of it.
and they asked them: " do you like to have a warehouse for nuclear waste in your country? "
it is surprising that 50 percent of the citizens answered yes.
they knew she was dangerous.
they may reduce the value of their property.
but they must be disposed of somewhere and have a sense of responsibility as citizens.
other psychologists asked a little different question about this question,
they said, " if we pay you every year for six weeks, do you accept that there is a nuclear waste repository in your community? "
that's my responsibility, and I'll pay for it, too.
instead of 50 % agreed earlier, only 25 % agreed.
what happened is that we've been very interested in providing incentives in the second question, and instead of asking, " what's my responsibility? "
all we asked him was, " what serves me? "
when the incentives are not found, when executive officials ignore the long-term prosperity of their companies in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to huge profits, the answer is always one:
he offered more incentives.
the truth is that you can never invent incentives that are huge enough.
any incentive system can destroy the corrupt intent.
we need incentives, people have to gain strength.
however, excessive reliance on incentives undermines professional activity with the word of meaning.
those engaged in this activity lose morale and the activity itself loses its ethics.
he said before he took office, " we shouldn't just ask, " is this a lucrative business? " is it true? " " is it true? " and when the professions lose their morals, all those who own them depend on the incentives or become addicted to the question. " is it true? "
we see this in medicine.
 although it is not serious, we must keep an eye on him to ensure that he will not turn into one of the major issues,  he said.
 to remain able to compete in the labour market today, I'm afraid we will replace you with a gang leader,  " I have sold myself about 10 for those cursed things now. " this is clearly not the way people want to do their jobs.
so what do we do?
there are a few sources of hope: we must strive to restore ethics to work.
there's one way she can't do this: teaching more ethical decisions.
(applause) there is no better way to show people that you are unserious than gathering everything you want to say about ethics in a small packaging wrapped in a tape of decorations and send it to the public as an educational decision on ethics.
what do we do instead?
first: to commend ethical models.
I admit, when you go to the law school, he's afraid of that voice that whispering in your ear: atticus finch.
a 10-year-old child does not go to the law school to work for mergers and acquisitions.
the heroes who have the decency to inspire people.
but we know that, with development, it comes to understanding that you can not admit that you have heroes that are unethical.
well, admit them.
and you have a pride that you have such heroes.
save them,
and I ask those who teach you to admit and celebrate them as well.
that's something we can do.
I don't know how many of you remember this: another moral hero, 15 years ago, there were haroon vowerstein, who was the owner of malden mills, massachusetts.
he had 3,000 workers. he kept them the owner of the factory and kept giving them their salary.
because she was going to be a disaster for them and the community if they were released from work.
maybe on paper, our company is worth nothing on the stock market, but I can tell you it's worth a lot.
in the same vein, we have heard here in tid to talk about many heroes who have experienced ethics.
there were two more specific things to me.
one of them is ray anderson, applause, you know, any trace of part of the evil empire or almost wiped out.
because it's the right thing to do.
and the reward he found out is that he'll make a lot more money.
this effort was an inspiration to his staff.
because their happiness was to do the right thing.
we heard yesterday and willie smith talks about indonesia's reafforestation.
(applause) from several aspects this is the perfect model.
he takes the will to do the right thing.
god knows it takes a lot of art skill.
he gives me the amount of knowledge that he and his associates need to clarify,
but most importantly, it is useful - that is what he stressed - that individuals must be identified within societies.
unless the individuals who work with you support you, it'll ruin it.
there is no recipe that tells you how people support you, and different people in different societies regulate their lives in different ways.
there are a lot of models here in tid and elsewhere, to save it,
and you don't have to be a superhero,
there are medical heroes.
like cleaning workers who deserve to be saved, too.
as practitioners, everyone of us must seek to become a natural hero, if he is not a superhero.
as heads of organizations, we must strive to create environments that encourage and feed both ethical skill and moral will.
even the people and their environs will be surrendered if they have to swim against the current in their organizations.
if you run an organization, you have to make sure there's no job - any job on the releases - has a job description that looks like this job description.
the fact that any action that requires dealing with other individuals is moral.
any moral action depends on the practical wisdom.
perhaps the most important thing we have to do as teachers is to seek to become natural heroes, and the moral models of the individuals we guide.
and there are a few things we need to remember as teachers.
first, we always know.
one of them is always watching.
the camera is always operational.
bill gates spoke of the importance of education, especially the model of the kipp " knowledge is the force. "
he spoke of many of the beautiful things that the programme was doing to take the children of those small villages and guide them until they arrived at the university.
I'd like to focus on one thing that this show does and bill gates hasn't mentioned it.
it is that they have reached that the only important thing that children need to study is personal.
they need to learn to respect their own.
and they learn to respect their colleagues,
they learn to respect their teachers.
most importantly, they need to learn to respect learning.
this is the main goal.
if you do it, the rest will easily go down the slope.
for teachers: the way we know these children is that teachers and other members of the group should reflect these things every minute and every day.
I've got obama to the virtue,
and I think he was right.
the virtue we need before anything is the practical wisdom, because it allows other virtues - such as honesty, compassion, courage, etc. - to appear in a timely and appropriate manner.
and I also wish you the hope,
he was right about it, too.
I think there's a hope.
I think people want to have a chance to become honest people.
in a few ways, that's what ted's got to do.
the desire to do what's right is right for the right reasons.
each of us can achieve this kind of wisdom if we begin to pay attention.
we pay attention to what we do, how we do it, and most importantly, is to draw attention to the structure of our institutions, to ensure that we and others can show wisdom rather than kill them.
thank you so much.
thank you.
chris anderson, here's a moment.
- barry schwartz. - thank you so much.
(applause) I wrote this poem after listening to a beautiful and known actress who says to one of the known broadcasters on television, " really, I have entered the modern world.
and I just meant if she was more organized. "
- that's it.
(laughs) if you were in the internet, you could have put your heart wound in bidding on ebay,
take the money, go to amazon, buy a phone guide to a state that you've never visited, call random people so you can find someone in a good way in a foreign language.
(laughs) if you're in charge of the internet, you'll be able to follow the volatility of your boyfriend's mood on the map of mapt quist.
you hang left on the volatile mood, right in the mind of the mind, go back in a silent way, and go on your way back to the deep kissing and beautiful love,
she'll be able to sail and understand all the emotional districts.
some days, I'm less deep than bread pan, but I'm still looking for miles in all directions.
if you were the owner of the internet, napester, monster and friedster dot com would be one big location.
that way you'll be able to listen to quiet music when you pretend to look for a job, and you're actually just chatting with your friends.
(laughs) hey, if you're a network manager, you'll be able to send an e-mail to the dead people.
(laughs) they won't get back to you - (laughs) but you'll get an automatic response.
(laughs) their names are in the incoming mail - (laughs) that's what you wanted anyway.
and a letter says, " dude, here I am.
(laughs) listen, you'll see being dead.
now come back to raise children and take care of peace and love for dessert. "
if you were designed for the internet, childhood dot com will become a ring for a boy in stan, with the ski column as a sword, the trash cover as a shield, screaming, " I'm the emperor of orange. "
I am the emperor of orange. I am emperor of orange.
now follow me, okay?
(laughs) grandma docom will be a recipe for cookies and spit instructions in the bathroom.
one, two, three.
this links us with dot com.
this is serious.
they take you to your military father who race in his fourth marriage.
a facility is somewhat fragmented, but it still sends ginger biscuits for christmas dot m, which put the boy down in the orchard, the orange emperor, who grew up to become me - the young man who usually is so overwhelmed.
so if I'm the internet, I think I'm gonna be a vineyard, huh?
but at this point, I may still have the least premiums for a mortgage and the biggest penis that has been broken - (laughs) so I'm blocking unwanted mail on my first day of work at the office.
I don't need it.
I'd like to be the internet genius, and I hope I'm gonna be great to be great, and maybe just like that - bob - I'm moving to you.
maybe google will hire this.
I'll be able to sneak through your servers and protection systems as a virus so that the network becomes that wisdom, ambition and organization.
I think it's like life.
it's not a question about whether you can.
we can interfere with the front.
we can make " you've got halaloya " a national club of virtual space at all times that you have to register in.
you're not going to say goodbye.
you won't write a religion.
or drop out of arrangements.
you'll send an e-mail to everyone you think of coming, da da da da da.
thank you, ted.
(applause) I told you about three things last year.
I told you the world statistics aren't available well.
for that reason, we have the old idea of the noble and industrialist states, and this is the wrong idea.
and those mobile charts are capable of change.
and today, on the main page of the united nations statistics section, he says, " at the beginning of may, there will be a full permit to enter the databases. "
(applause) if you'll let me share your picture on the screen.
three things happened.
the united nations opened its statistical data service, and now we have a new issue of the program that works on the internet, so you don't need to download it anymore.
let me repeat what you saw last year.
bubbles are states.
here we have the birth or fertility ratio - the number of children per female - and here you have a lifetime of age.
this is in 1950. these were industrialized nations, and those were developing countries.
and at this time, we used to use " us " and " them. "
there was a big gap between the two worlds.
but that changed and changed to the better.
and that's what's going on.
you'll see how china represents a big red bubble:
blue there is india.
and all this goes wrong, I'll try to be more serious this year, and I show you how much things have changed.
and this is africa, which is still a problem down there, right?
families are still large, and the outbreak of the hiv epidemic has led to the poor condition of that country.
that's the one or the last thing we saw last year, and that's how it'll last in the future.
and I'll keep talking. is that possible?
because you see now, I've provided statistics that don't exist.
because that's what we are now.
can this happen?
I'm covering my life here, you know?
I expect to live for 100 years.
and that's what we are now.
now, can we see the world's economic situation?
and I'd like to show you this against the survival rate of children.
we'll reverse it.
here we have the infant mortality rate - or the survival rate - 4 children die here, 200 children out there.
this is the gross domestic production of the individual on this axis.
that was 2007.
come on, come on, come on, come on, there's no statistics for 100 years.
and some country had statistics.
we're looking across the archive, until we get to 1820, just austria and sweden can issue numbers.
(laughs) but they were down here, they had productivity at the rate of $1,000 per capita.
and they lost five children before their first year.
and that's what happens in the world, if we offer the whole world.
how they're becoming more slowly and more rich, and they add statistics.
isn't it great that they add statistics?
do you see how important that is?
and here the kids don't live so much.
in the previous century, 1870 was a bad year for the children of europe, because most of those statistics were in europe.
only when this century ended, more than 90 % of the children lived their first year.
and there's india showing up, and the first data from india.
and this is the united states moving away here, earning more money.
then we'll see china show up in this far corner.
and move up under the presidency of mao zed-tenge and grow up in health, and don't grow up in rich.
then he dies, and deng xiaoping begins to enter the money,
and move that way here.
and bubbles keep moving here up, and that's what the world looks like now.
(applause) let's take a look at the united states.
we have a mission here. I can tell the world, " stay as you are. "
and I'll take the united states, but I still want to see the world in the background.
and we can see that the united states is moving in the right part of the current.
they're always on the financial side.
in 1915, the united states was in the vicinity of india - current india, at present.
that means the united states was richer, but they were losing more children than india lost today, relatively.
and look here - compared to the philippines today.
the philippines today has almost the same economy as the united states of america, the most volatile world war.
but we must attract the united states a little ahead to find some health in the united states like that we see in the philippines.
here in 1957, public health in the united states is similar in the philippines now.
this is the drama of this world, which many people are aware of, that asia, the arab world and latin america are much more advanced in health, education and human resources than economic progress.
there is a disapproval of what happens today in emerging economies.
now there are social benefits, social progress, greater economic progress.
in 1957, the united states had the same economy as chile today.
and how long will we go up to the united states to reach the same level of health in chile?
I think we're going here - here in 2001 or 2002 - the united states has the same level of health as chile.
then check it out!
in a few years, the survival rate of children in chile may be higher than the united states.
this is a real change. this time difference in health is 30 or 40 years.
and behind the health, the level of education is.
there are many infrastructure factors and public human resources.
and now let's leave this - and I want to offer you the speed rate and the rate of change, how fast they can change.
and we go back to 1920 and I want to follow japan.
sweden and the united states.
and I'm gonna have a race here between the yellow ford here and the red toyota over there and the brown volvo.
(laughs) let's go.
the toyota started a very bad start down the way you see, and the american ford comes out of the way there.
and the volvo goes well.
the toyota's out of the way, and now the toyota's on the most healthy side of sweden.
and they're making a mistake for sweden, and they're more healthy than sweden.
and that's the time I sold my volvo car and bought the toyota.
(laughs) now, it is considered that the rate of change was enormous in japan.
they followed up fast!
and that comes gradually.
we have to look across generations to understand that.
and let me show you my kind of family history. we made these charts here.
and it's the same thing, money down and health, got it?
and this is my family.
this is sweden in 1830, when my grandmother was born.
sweden was at the same level as sierra leone today.
and that's when my mother's grandmother was born, 1863.
and sweden is at the same level as mozambique today.
and that's when my grandmother was born in 1891.
and I took care of me and I'm a child, so I'm not talking about statistics right now.
these are the statistics I believe when you are certified by my grandmother!
(laughs) I think it's the best way to verify the authenticity of historical statistics.
sweden was at the ghana level.
it's exciting to see this huge diversity inside the southern africa desert.
I told you last year, and I'll tell you again, my mother was born at the level of egypt and me.
I'm mexican in the family.
and my daughter was born at chile's level, and my granddaughter was born at the same level as singapore, and now the world's most healthy countries.
sweden has taken over two or three years, at a higher rate for the survival of children.
but their country is very small, you know.
they are very close to hospitals. we can never defeat them in this field.
(laughs) but our respect for singapore.
singapore is the best now.
now that sounds like a very happy story.
but it's not that easy to be all happy.
because I have to show you the other face of the coin.
- we can also make the color change. - what am I going to choose here?
carbon dioxide emissions, metric tons per capita
this is 1962, and the united states fired 16 tons per capita.
china was about 0.6. india fired 0.32 tonnes per capita.
and what happened when we introduced time?
well, you see, the happy song story and the better health - and everybody got this on carbon dioxide emissions.
there's no one who doesn't even divorce him yet.
and we don't have all the updated data because these data are very important these days.
and here we are in 2001.
and in the debate I attended with world leaders, as you know, a lot of them say, the problem is in the developing economy, they're taking a lot of carbon dioxide.
the indian environment minister said, " well, you're the one who caused the problem in the first place. "
oecd - high-income states - they have caused climate change.
but we forgive you, because you won't know.
but from now on, we count for the individual.
from now on, we count for the individual.
everyone is responsible for individual emissions. "
it is clear that there has been no economic progress or health progress anywhere in the world without the destruction of the climate.
that's what we have to change.
I've been criticized because I show you a positive picture of the world, but I don't think it is.
this world is a very confused place.
that's what we call dollar street.
everybody lives in this world.
what they earn here - the amount they live on - is what they earn one day.
this family earn about one dollar a day.
then we head up the street here, and we find a family earning about two or three dollars a day.
and we're heading away from here. we find the first park on the street, and they get 10 to 50 dollars a day.
and how do they live?
if we look at the bed here, we can see they're sleeping on the floor.
this is the poverty line - 80 % of that family's return goes to their energy needs, which is today's food.
this is from 2 to 5 dollars. you have a bed.
and this is a much better bedroom, as you can see.
I gave a lecture on this subject in akia, and they wanted to see the couch for me right here.
(laughs) and this is the couch. you'll see how you're evolving from here.
and the interesting thing is that when we move in the perimeter of this picture, you'll see that the rest of the family is still sitting on the ground.
and if we see the kitchen, you'll see that the big difference that the woman asks doesn't come from a dollar to ten.
it takes a lot more than that to get the conditions of life that are harmonious in the family.
and if you want to see the difference, look at the restroom here.
this is a reality that can be changed. change is possible.
all these pictures from africa, and the situation can be much better.
we can get out of poverty.
my own research wasn't at it or something.
I spent 20 years in interviews with african farmers who were on the verge of famine.
these are the results of research on farmers' needs.
and the nice thing here is that you can't disperse looking for the rest of the picture.
that's what happens when research works for societies. you have to live already with people.
and when you live in poverty, your whole life is about survival.
about finding food.
these small farmers - are women workers because their parents died from hiv and aids - and they are discussing with a dedicated agricultural engineer.
this is one of the best agricultural engineers in malawi, juntampa kubera, and they are discussing any kind of cassava who will plant it - the best plant known to mankind in turning sunlight into food.
and they're very excited to get advice, and this is to survive poverty.
this is one context for the bar.
out of poverty.
women have told us there's one thing. " give us the technology. "
we hate this manual, we stand for hours and hours.
get us a mill to grind the flour, then we'll be able to pay the rest of the rest ourselves. "
technology will get you out of poverty, but you need a market to get out of poverty.
this woman is very happy now and brings her products to the market.
but she's also grateful for popular investment in education. she can count, and she won't be fooled in the market.
she wants her baby to be healthy, so she can go to the market and don't have to stay with him at home.
and she wants a strong infrastructure. it's nice to have the way.
and also make loans available.
small loans are the ones that that bike gave her.
and the information will tell her when you go to the market and any product.
we can do that.
I have learned from the experience of 20 years in africa that what we think is impossible is indeed possible.
africa's performance is not that bad.
in 50 years, they have moved from a premediated position to a well-developed position for europe 100 years ago, with the mother and the appropriate effective cases.
I would like to say that sub-saharan africa in africa is the best performance in the world over the past 50 years.
because we don't consider where they were before.
this is this stupid concept of developing countries, which places argentina and mozambique 50 years ago and says mozambique was worse.
we need to know more about the world.
I have this neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
he knows everything about her!
he knows the name of grapes, the right temperature, everything.
and I know only two types of wine, white and red.
(laughs) but only two types of industrialized and developing countries are known.
and I know 200, and I know all the little data.
but you can know that, too.
(applause) but I have to get more serious, and how are you even more serious?
you make bauer point, you know?
(laughs) we keep our office down, right?
what's that, what's that, what am I saying?
I'm telling you, there's a lot of dimensions to development.
everybody wants their pet.
if you're in the corporate sector, you like small loans.
and if you're fighting in a non-governmental organization, you'd love gender equality.
and if you were a teacher, you'd love the unesco and that way.
but on the global scale, we have to have more than one favorite thing.
we need everything.
all those things are important to development, especially when you're just out of poverty, and you want to go to the well-being and recovery.
and now that needs to be thought, what's the point of evolution, and what means of access to malt?
let me just arrange what the most important means.
for me, economic growth, as a public health professor, is the most important thing to achieve development because it represents 80 % of the causes of survival.
the rule is, you have an effective government - that's what brought california out of misery in 1850.
the government was finally implementing the law.
education, human resources is important.
health, too important, but not as a way.
the environment is important.
human rights are also important, but they get one.
now what about the targets?
we don't care about money.
money's not an end.
it's the best way, but it's as much as nothing.
judgment, well, voting in the election is fun, but it's not an end.
and the tail to school, it's not a target. it's a way.
I mean, it's good to be healthy, especially at my age, you can stand here because you're healthy.
and that's a good thing, taking my mark plus.
the environment is something of fate and very fundamental.
if you don't save her, you won't leave anything to save you.
but where are the important targets?
of course it's human rights.
human rights are a goal, but not a powerful means of achieving development and progress.
culture is the most important thing for me, because this is what brings happiness to life.
that's what's worth living.
if it seems impossible, it's actually possible.
even african states can achieve this.
and I showed you the footage that seems impossible to do.
and remember, please remember my basic message, which seems impossible.
we can get a great world.
I showed you footage, and I proved it in a powerpoint show, and I think I'll also convince you of culture.
(laughs) (applause) bring me my sword!
swallow the sword is from ancient india.
it's a cultural term since thousands of years have inspired humans to think deeper than the surface.
and I'll prove to you now that it seems impossible to take that piece of steel iron, this is the war war from the swedish army in 1850 in the last year of war.
it's a kidney steel. as you hear here.
I will take this iron code and push it through my blood and flesh, to prove that it seems impossible.
is it possible for a minute of silence?
(applause) this big particle collider.
27 kilometres ;
it's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.
more than 10,000 physics scientists and engineers from 85 countries from all over the world have come together over several decades to build this machine.
what we do is accelerate protons - so, hydrogen core - about 99.99999999 percent of the speed of light.
well, at that speed, they run 11,000 times on that train, which is 27 kilometres away.
we are shocked by another protons of protons going in the opposite direction.
we hit her inside giant detectors.
it's basically digital cameras.
that's what I'm working on in the atlas experiment.
you can feel the size - considering people size of european union standards under drawing.
(laughs) you get some size: 44 metres for the show, 22 metres, 7,000 tons.
we will recreate the conditions that existed at less than 2 billion seconds after the start of the universe - up to 600 million times the second in this shiv - huge numbers.
if you see these magnetic coins out there - that's the one that changes the direction of the molecules, so that it can measure how fast they are.
this picture is about a year ago.
those magnets inside there.
once again, a real person is the size of the european union standards so that they can get some sense of measure.
there are those great mini-explosions that will be set up at some point in the summer of this year.
in fact, this morning, I received an e-mail that says that we ended up, today, from building the last piece of atlas experience.
if from today, it's over. I'd say that's what I planned for ted, but I didn't.
(applause) yeah, it's a great achievement.
so, you might ask " why? "
why did he create the conditions that existed less than 1 billion seconds after the universe began? "
well, particle physics scientists don't be normal ; if they're not ambitious.
the purpose of particle physics is to understand the components of the manufacture of all things, and how all things are stuck together.
and with all things, I mean, of course, you and me, the earth, the sun, and the 100 billion sun in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies that can be observed in the universe.
everything at all.
now you can say, " okay, okay, but why don't we just look at that?
if you want to know what I'm made, let's look at me. "
well, we found looking back in time, the universe was more and more hot, more intense, more intense, more simple.
now, there's no real reason to realize that, but it seems like this is the case.
so, back in the early times of the universe, we think it was very simple and understandable.
all this complexity, up to these wonderful things - the human brain - is king of the oldest and cold universe.
back to the beginning, in the first billion seconds, we think, or we noticed, it was so simple.
it's almost like...
imagine a snow chip in your hand, looked at it, and it's incredibly complicated, a beautiful object, but by heating it, you're gonna melt into a pool of water, and you'll be able to see it ; actually, it was just one of h2, water.
so it's the same thing that we look back in time to understand what's made of this universe.
for the time being, it's made of these things.
only 12 molecules of substance are attached together with a powerful four of nature.
the carats, these pink things, are the things that form protons and neutrons that form the atomic power of your body.
the electron - the thing about corn core - restricted in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic power transferred through this thing, the futton.
and the quarts are stuck together by other things called glutes.
and these guys are here, they're the weakest strength of the nucleus, perhaps the less affluent.
but without them, the sun won't shine.
and when the sun rises, you can get a large amount of these things called the neurons.
in fact, if you just take a look at your thumb - about a square centimeter - there's about 60 billion neutrals in one second of the sun, drop every square centimeter of your body.
but you don't feel them, because they call them a very right name.
these molecules have been detected over the past century largely.
the first one, electron, discovered in 1897, and the last one, this thing called tao nytreino, in 2000, in fact, I wanted to say, the highest route in chicago, and I know it's a big country, america, isn't it?
up the road.
ratio to the universe, it's the highest way.
so, this thing was discovered in 2000, so it's a relatively recent picture.
one of the great things, actually, which I find, is finding any one of them, when you realize how small they are.
you know, they're a step compared to the whole universe that can be observed.
if 100 billion galaxies, 13.7 billion light-years away - are a step compared to those to monterrey, in fact, it is the same as from monterrey for these things.
it's quite accurate, in all the meaning of the word, and yet, we almost discovered the whole group.
so, one of the most ancestors of our faith, at manchester university, ernest ratherford, discovered the corn core, once, " all science is either physics or stamps. "
well, I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science, even though it was from new zealand, so it's possible.
(laughs) but what he meant is that what we did, actually, is collecting stamps from there.
well, we have discovered molecules, but unless you understand the hidden cause of that pattern, you know, why you built the same as it - you actually collected stamps - you didn't do science.
fortunately, we have perhaps one of the largest scientific achievements of the 20th century that supports this pattern.
it's newton's law, if you want to make a great physics.
his name is " standard model " - simple mathematical equation.
you can put it on, t-shart, and that's always the sign of style.
there he is.
(laughs) I've been a little tricky, because I've extended it with all his violent details.
this amended, though, allows you to calculate everything - except gravity - happening in the universe.
if you want to know why the sky is blue, why don't you stick corn with each other - in principle, you have a big computer enough - why the dna has the shape it is.
in principle, you should be able to calculate that from this equation.
but there's a problem.
can anyone see what she is?
a bottle of champagne for anyone tells me.
I'll make it easier. actually, one of the lines.
basically, each of these terms indicates some particles.
the w notes refer to the wls, and how to stick together.
and the weak force carriers, the z letters, likewise.
but there's an extra code in this equation: h
right, h.
h cross the higgs.
the higgs particles haven't been detected.
but it's necessary - it's necessary to make these mathematics work.
so all the most detailed accounts that we can do through this creative equation will not be possible without an additional part.
so this is forecast - a new particle forecast.
what's he doing?
well, we had a long time to get good attention.
and previously in the '80s, when we wanted the money for the giant particle collider from the british government, margaret thatcher said at that time, " if you can explain, in a language that a politician can understand, what are you doing?
I want to know what the haggis is doing.
and we've got this analogy, and it seems to be working.
well, what higgs does is give a mass of basic particles.
and the picture is that the whole universe doesn't mean space, that means me, too, and in you - the whole universe is filled with something called the higgs field.
haggs particles, if you want.
the analogy is that these people in a room are higgs particles.
now when a big move moves across the universe, he can interact with those haggis particles.
but imagine someone who has no big popularity moving across the room.
then everybody's ignoring him, he can go through the room so fast, basically the speed of light, he doesn't have a mass.
and imagine someone who's incredibly important and highly popular and smart in the room.
people will be surrounded by people, and pass through the room to be disabled.
it's almost like it gets heavier.
and that's exactly how the higgs technique works.
the picture is that electrons and carats in your body and in the universe we see are heavy, meaning, large mass, because they're surrounded by higgs particles.
she interacts with the higgs field.
if this picture is correct, we have to find out those haggs particles in the giant particle collider.
if it is not true - because it is a very complex mechanism, even though it is the simplest we can think about - what the haggis function has been doing now is to look at it in the giant particle collider.
and this is one of the first reasons that we build that giant machine.
I'm glad you knew margaret thatcher.
actually, I thought I'd make this more culturally connected, but... (laughs) anyway.
so, " that's one thing. "
this is basically a safeguard for what the giant particle collider will find.
there are so many other things you've known a lot of diligent in particle physics.
one of them heard it: dark matter, dark energy.
there's another case, and it's that the forces in nature - that's pretty beautiful, actually - it seems, while it comes back in time, it seems to be changing in its intensity.
well, she's changing in her intensity already.
if the electromagnetic force, the power that keeps us together, it's hard while moving to higher temperatures.
strong strength, severe nuclear power, which sticks to each other, weakens. what you see in the standard model - you can count how to change - the powers - the three powers, not gravity - seem almost to converge on one point.
it almost seems like there was a beautiful kind of great power, old time at the beginning of time.
but she's failing.
now there's a theory called supersymmetry, and it doubled the number of particle in the standard model, which, for the first time, doesn't seem like a simplification.
but in fact, by this theory, the forces of nature seem to be bound by each other, old in the great explosion, a truly remarkable prophecy that the model has not built to do it, but it seems to be doing it.
also, those analogue particles are a powerful candidate to be dark matter.
so, " theory imposes itself hard, and it's actually universal physics. "
and if I'm gonna put the money in it, I'd put the money - in a completely unscientific way, that these things would show up in the giant particle collider.
so many other things can be discovered by the giant particle collider.
but in the last few minutes, I want to give you a different perspective for what I think - what actually means particle physics - particle physics and cosmic science.
it is that I think she gave us a great narrative - almost a story of creation, if you want - from the universe, from modern science over the last few decades.
and I can say it's worth, in the spirit of wade davis' talk, at least to be placed up there with those great creation stories for people from the high andean mountains and the frozen north.
this is a story of creation. I think it's as good as it is.
the story is as follows: we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago, in extreme heat and intensity, much smaller than one atom.
I think I've been shot, after the big bang.
gravity broke away from the other powers.
and the universe was subject to the extension of a mass called inflation.
in about the first 1 billion of the second, the higgs field began to appear, the carjackets, the glutes and the electrons that formed a block.
the universe continued to expand and its temperature decreased.
and a few minutes later, hydrogen and helium found in the universe.
the universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium, and it's still like that today.
it continued to stretch about 300 million years.
then the light began to travel across the universe.
it was big enough to be a light " lips, " and that's what we see in the background of the universe of microwaves, and george smoot described it as looking at god's face.
about 400 million years later, the first stars formed, and this hydrogen, this helium, began to form heavier elements,
if " elements of life - carbon, oxygen and iron, all the elements we need to be together - it has been formed in these first generations of stars, which has run out of fuel and exploded, these elements have thrown into the universe again.
then you gathered again to be a new generation of stars and planets.
and on some of these planets, oxygen created in this first generation of stars could be integrated with hydrogen to be water, liquid water on the surface.
at least one of these planets has evolved, the primitive life, which has evolved over millions of years into things that have been connected and left footprints for about three million years and half ago in the mud plains in tanzania, and finally, " left a trail on another world. "
and the daughter of this civilization, this creative picture, which turned darkness into light, and you can see civilization from space.
as one of the great heroes said, carl sajan, these are things - and in fact not only these things, but I've been looking around. these are things, like slornv rockets, sputnik, dna, literature and science - these are the things hydrogen atoms do when they give 13.7 billion years.
sure. it's worth noting.
and the laws of physics, right?
so, " the right laws of physics - are well-balanced. "
if the weak force was a little different, it wasn't carbon and oxygen to be stable within the stars' hearts, and it wouldn't have been any of this in the universe.
and I think this is a great and meaningful story.
50 years ago, I wouldn't be able to tell this story because we didn't know it.
and she really makes me feel like this civilization - which, as I say, if you believe the scientific creation story, has simply emerged as a result of the laws of physics, some hydrogen atoms - and then I think, for myself, it makes me feel good about myself.
so this is the giant particle collider.
the giant particle collider is really, when the next summer works, he'll write the next chapter in this book.
and I'm already looking forward to making a big rush to work.
thank you.
(applause) how many of you have seen the movie " the birds "?
did any of you find this gay?
maybe they should leave now.
(laughs) so this is a crows machine.
and in the past few days, many of you asked me how you got this, how did you start doing this?
and it started, like all great ideas, or a lot of ideas that you can't get away from, at a dinner party.
about ten years ago, I was at a dinner party with a friend of mine and we were sitting there, and he was complaining of the crows who saw it happen in every courtyard of his house.
he was telling me that we really should, eliminate all these things.
we have to kill them because they're destruction.
you said that's a stupid act, you know, maybe we should just train them to do something useful.
he told me that's impossible.
and I'm sure I'm in good company with knowledge of amazing knowledge when someone tells you that's impossible.
so I spent the next ten years reading about the crows in my spare time.
(laughs) ten years after this, my wife eventually said, " look, you know, you have to do this thing you've been talking about and build the vending machine. "
so you accomplished that.
but part of the reason I found that this is exciting is that I'm starting to notice that we are very aware of all the creatures on their way to extinction from the planet as a result of the expansionist activities of humans, and no one seems to be interested in all living creatures.
specifically speaking of creatures associated with human beings, which are specifically adapted to human environments, creatures like mice, cockroaches and crows.
and since I began to know about them, I was finding that they were very active.
they've become very good to live in us.
in return, we just try to kill them all the time.
and by doing so, we raise them on the intrusion.
we were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt to new ways.
so, for example, mice raise an incredibly responsive response.
and the cockroaches, as everyone who tried to get rid of them, have already got immune to the poisons we use.
so I thought, let's build something mutually beneficial.
well, then let's build something for the parties, and we get to ways to create a new relationship with these creatures.
so I built the vending machine.
but the story of the vending machine is a little interesting if you know more about the crows.
he made it clear that the crows don't live only with humans - she's already thriving.
it's everywhere on the planet except the poles and the southern part of south america.
in all that area, they are rarely thrived five kilometres from humans.
so maybe we don't think of them, but they're always around.
it is not a surprise, considering population growth - more than half of the earth's population lives in cities now.
of these, nine are from the population growth rate in cities.
we're witnessing a population explosion with the crows.
if the number of birds is an indication that we may see an accelerated growth in their preparation.
so that's not a big surprise.
but the really exciting thing for me was to know that birds are adapting in an unusual way.
and I'll give you an example.
so this is betty. it's a new garage in caldonia.
these crows are using the sticks in the wild to get insects and other logging.
and here she is trying to get a steak out of the pipe.
but the researchers encountered a problem.
they're wrong and they left a piece of a bar there.
she didn't have the chance to try it before.
you notice, you didn't do the job well.
so you've adapted.
now that's so spontaneous, you didn't see that happen before.
nobody taught her to bend this into a hook, nobody taught her how that could happen.
but she did her own way.
so they put in the punch that she didn't see that happen before.
right.
(laughs) yeah, okay.
(applause) so that's the part where the researchers screwed up.
(laughs) so it turns out that we're starting to know more and more that the crows are really, really smart.
her brains are proportionate, in the same way as the chimpanzee brains.
all these different types of intelligence they have.
for example, in sweden, the crows are waiting for the fishers to leave a hole in the ice.
when the hunter leaves, the crows go down, land down, eat fish or taste.
she's so annoying to the hunter.
in a completely different course, at washington university, they were, several years ago, experimenting with some crows on campus.
some students came out and arrested some crows, brought them, threw them up, carried them measurements and others, and then released them again.
they have enjoyed the discovery that in the rest of the week, these crows, as soon as those students walk on campus, the crows are in the wake of them, damaged and turned around and make their lives miserable.
they were less happy when you continue this for the next week.
and the next month, and after the summer break.
and they were happy to leave, I'm sure - they came back later after a while, and they found that the crows still remember them.
- so morally, don't piss off the crows.
so now, students at washington university who teach these crows do that with a big mask and a big wig.
(laughs) it's very interesting.
if we now know that the crows are so smart, but the more I dig in this, the more I find it, they actually have more important adaptation.
video: the crows have become highly skilled for livelihoods in these new urban environments.
in this japanese city, they devised a way to eat the food that usually can't eat.
the problem is now to assemble the pieces without the cars going down.
they're waiting for the signal to stop the way.
after that, they collect broken pills in safety.
(laughs) joshua klein: yes, yes.
so the important thing about this is not that the crows benefit from cars to break the nut.
actually, this is an old trick for strangers.
this happened about 10 years ago in a place called sinai city, in a school driving school on the outskirts of tokyo.
and since then, all the crows around the neighborhood learn that attitude.
now, every grape is five kilometres waiting near the crossing walk waiting to collect tomorrow.
so they learn from each other, and the research testifies to that.
looks like parents know their kids.
they learned from their peers. they learned from their enemies.
if I had extra time, I could tell you about a state of treason for a raven, which explains that he's cute.
a point that they have developed cultural adjustment.
yesterday, we have heard that the panorb fund that enters humans is a problem, and we are beginning to witness it.
they can adapt quickly and smoothly to new challenges and new resources in their environments, which are already useful if you live in a city.
so we know there's a lot of crows.
we've reached that she's really smart, and we know they know each other.
and when all this became clear to me, I realized that the only natural thing is that my son is the vending machine.
so that's what we did.
this is a vending machine.
service training is used to shape its behaviour around four stages.
it's very simple.
basically, what happens is that we're putting this in a field, or anywhere where there's a lot of crows, and we put cash coins and a peanuts around the machine base.
it's obvious that the crows come and eat peanuts and begin to get used to the machine there.
and eventually, eat all peanuts.
and then they see that there's peanuts here on the feed box, and they help themselves.
and then they leave, the machine goes out more coins and peanuts, and life is so unique if you're weird.
then you can go back any time and get peanuts.
so when you get used to it so hard, we move back to the crows.
now, they used to sound the machine, keep going back, spread peanuts out of a pile of metal parts there.
and when they're really happy about this, we go on and down.
we move to the third stage, where we only give them metal pieces.
now, like most of us who used to have good things, that's already frustrating them.
so they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something - they kiss things to find a way out through their seats.
and they do it here, and that makes the coin down the coin, and when this happens, they get peanuts.
and this goes on for a while.
the crows learn that they should do something for the outcome, wait for the coin to show, put the coin in the coin, then get the beans.
and when they're really good and comfortable with this, we move to the final stage, where they come and don't get nothing.
and here we see the difference between the crows and the rest of the animals.
the squirrels, for example, will come, search for the beans, and leave.
come again, look for the beans, and leave.
they do it repeatedly before they get to the boredom, and then they go and play in motion.
the crows, on the contrary, appear, and try to know.
they know this machine was tampered with, across three different stages of conduct.
(laughs) they know that more should be done.
so they're holding them and they're moving them and others.
eventually, the crows take a bright idea that, " hey, there's a lot of coins in the first phase, scattered on the ground, " " jump down, pick it up, throw it on the piece. "
and then we're out of races.
where the crows enjoy a temporary monopoly of peanuts so his friends know how to do it, and then they continue.
so the important thing about this for me is not that we can train the crows to pick up peanuts.
watch out, there's a change of $216 million per year, but I'm not sure I can count on the crows in investment returns.
instead, I think we should look a little bit bigger.
I think the crows can be trained to do so many other things.
for example, why don't we train them to pick up the trash after it happened at a gym?
or find the expensive parts of electronics trash?
or maybe do a search and rescue?
the main point, the main point for all of this is that we can find a mutually beneficial system between these creatures.
we can find ways of interacting with these other creatures that do not have their excesses, but they have a balance with them and a useful balance.
thank you very much.
nine days ago, I got a fire.
archife: 175 film, 16 millimetres, all my books, and my father wrote.
- I collected it. - for a long time, I've been gathering.
they're all gone.
I looked at her, and I didn't know what to do.
I mean, it was... was I living between my holdings?
- I always live in the present. - I love the present.
the best future.
I learned when I was a little weird, like, you have to make a good thing from the last bad.
you have to make something good from the last bad.
that was bad, man, I was going to cough.
the first camera I imagined was bob dylan for 35 years.
this is my film, king murray, who won the 1970 film festival, the only version I have.
these are my papers.
- that happened in minutes. - 20 minutes.
suddenly I realized something, something I got.
you have to make a good thing from the last bad thing that I'm starting to want on my friends, neighbors and my sister.
by the way, this is spaghetti: satellite, last year.
spaghetti, the nigerian was in the middle of the city, he didn't touch it.
these are some pieces of stuff you've used in my movie, spaghetti, which was opened in new york two weeks ago in the middle of the city.
I called my sister. I called the neighbors. I told them, " come find it. "
that's me in my office.
40 years of construction.
- you know. - the rest of the things.
this is my daughter, jane.
she came, she works a nurse in san francisco.
I said, " look. " " cut. "
I want the pieces and the parts.
I came up with this idea: a life of pieces and parts, which I started working on - my next draft.
this is my sister, I care about the pictures, you're a big college college, and you say so much about me.
and these are some pictures - something was good about burning pictures.
I didn't know, I said, " wow, that's better than - this is my show for jimmy dolittle project.
it's the only version I own. parts of it.
an idea about women.
I'm starting to say, " man, you're overreacting! "
you might cry for this, actually. I didn't cry.
instead, I said, " I'll make something from him, maybe next year, " and I'm grateful for this moment to get up on this stage with a lot of people who gave me a lot of sulfate, and I'm telling the ted community: I'm proud of myself because I got something bad and his heart, and I'm gonna do something good from him.
this is an original picture I loved for arthur lipzig.
I told you the movie burned down, the movie burned down.
I mean, this was a 16-millimeter movie.
the negev burned down.
this is my father's message to me, telling me to marry the woman who was my first wife when I was 20 years old.
this is my daughter and me.
actually, she's there this morning.
this is my house.
my family lives at the hilton hotel in scott valley.
this is my wife, heidi, who didn't take the shock as you did.
my children, davey and henry.
my son, davy at the hotel two nights ago.
my message to you guys, from my three minutes, I'm grateful for this opportunity to share this with you, I'd be back later, I'd love to be here in ted.
I came to live her and I live her now.
this view from my window with santa cruz in bonnie dawn, 35 miles from here.
thank you all.
(applause) when I was president of the american psychology society, attempted training on media meetings, saddam benny and cnn summarized what I'm about to talk about today, and it's about " 11 reasons to be optimistic. "
the editor of the disco magazine mentioned 10 reasons, and I'll give you the 11th reason.
so, the cnn came to meet professor selegman. can you talk about the psychology situation today?
 we like to host you on this subject.  I told them " great. "
and the announcer told me that this is cnn. I have to answer a short talk.
I said, " well, how many words do I have to answer their limits? "
she told me, " well, one word. "
(laughs) then the cameras turned out to me and asked me, " professor selegman, what's the psychology situation today? "
 good. 
(laughs) " cut. " that won't work.
we'd better give you more words. "
 how many words I get this time?  " I think, okay, two words. "
 professor siligman, what's the status of psychology today? 
 not good. 
(laughs) " look, dr. siligman, we see you're not really comfortable in this middle.
we'll really give you a long time to answer it.
this time three words.
 professor siligman, what's the status of psychology today? 
it's not good enough, and that's what I'm gonna tell you about.
I want to say why psychology was in good condition, and why not now and how within the next 10 years might be good enough.
and as a summary of a parallel subject, I want to say the same thing on technical research, entertainment and determination, because I think it's similar subjects.
why was psychology in a good condition?
well, for over 60 years, psychology has taken care of the disease model.
and 10 years ago, I was on a plane that I gave myself to sitting next to me, and I told him what you did, moving away from me.
and because he said and he was right, psychology was looking for what happened to people.
and now when I tell people about my job, they're getting closer to me.
which was good in psychology for 30 billion spent by the national psychiatric institute, for work on the disease model, what psychology means, that over the past 60 years, there is no single psychological illness that is treated for treatment.
and now there are 14 therapy patients, actually, two of whom are treated for treatment.
the other thing that happened was that science evolved from mental illness.
that we found out that we can take the blurred ideas like depression or alcoholism and their exact measurement.
we can develop a classification of the disease.
we can understand the loss of mental illness.
we can look through time for the same people, for example, people exposed to schizophrenia, the extent to which genes contribute to the matter of motherhood, and we can isolate a third variable by conducting experiments on mental illness.
the best thing at all is that over the past 50 years we've been able to invent medical and psychological treatments.
we have been able to measure those treatments accurately thanks to the random election, which makes the plassibo unaffected (plisbo = hissibo treatment) factor out of the factors that do not help and keep things working positive.
in short, psychology and psychiatry over the past 60 years can really claim that we can make the misery less miserable.
I'm proud of that.
but the thing that wasn't good is the consequences of that, three consequences.
first morally, psychologists and psychiatrists became specialists in pathology, the victim's analysis and our perspective of human nature that if you were in crisis, it meant that you had no income.
and we forgot that people have chosen and made decisions.
we forgot their responsibilities, which was the first cost.
the second sentence is that we neglect you as human beings.
we have neglected to improve normal life.
we forgot the task of making the normal lives of people relatively happier, more satisfying and productive, and words like a genius or " very talented " are dirty words.
nobody worked on it.
the third problem of the disease model is, if we hurry to do something for a psychopath, in case we hurry to do something that addresses the imbalance, we have not thought of our ability to " intervene " = the focus model on the desired position in the future to make people happier by " interventions " positive.
and that wasn't good.
and that's what people like nancy echov, dan gilbert and mike skizintamali, and I'm with them to work on what he's called positive psychology, which aims for three things.
first, psychology must be concerned with human power and human vulnerability.
he must be interested in building power as the same interest in the rift.
he must be anxious for the best things in life,
and he's equally interested in making the lives of ordinary people happy to care for genius and foster care.
therefore, over the past 10 years and hope for the future, we have seen his positive psychology: it makes life worth living.
and it turns out to be able to measure different forms of happiness.
and any one of you and for free can go to that electronic site and measure his happiness in all the tests.
you can ask how you have your positive emotions and suffering, and you spend it on a craftsmanship - tens of thousands of people?
we have found the reverse evidence to diagnose mental illness: classification of strengths and virtues of women and men on each other, and how to define those points and diagnose them, what they create in the first place and what they are in.
and we found that we can find the reason for the positive psychological situation, the relationship between the left brain activity and the one as a reason for happiness.
I spent my life working on the treatment of people who are psychologically broken, and I asked that question, how are these people different from the rest of the people?
and six years ago, I've been wondering about happy happy, so...
and how are they different from us?
and turn it into one way.
they're not the most powerful ones, and they're not the most physically healthy, their money isn't more, and their forms aren't better, they don't have any more good occasions than their bad practice.
they're only different in one way: they're a remote meeting.
they don't hold forums on saturday morning.
(laughs) don't spend time alone.
each of them has an emotional relationship, and either of them have a wide number of friends.
but be careful here, this is only scientific data, and no one else is happy about the hollywood way I'm going to tell you about it: joy, crap and fun.
and I'll suggest you not enough within a minute.
and we found that we could examine psychological interventions during centuries, from california to tony robbins.
about 120 proposed patterns of psychological intervention, which are alleged to make people happy.
and we found that we could record those patterns in a user guide, and we actually conducted random experiments to study efficiency and effectiveness.
- to the patterns that actually - make people happier in the long run?
in the next few minutes, I'll tell you some of our findings.
but the final outcome that I wanted to enjoy, in addition to his mission to treat the mentally ill, in addition to his mission to make the misery less miserable, is the answer to: can psychology make people happier?
and to ask that question, especially since happiness is a word I don't use so much, we have to break the question to facilitate the answer to it.
and I think there are three different types, and I tell them different because of patterns that cause them, and it's possible to get some kind of different types of happy life.
the first kind of happy life is a good life.
and it's a kind of life during which a number of positive emotions have been enjoyed as much as you can, and skills help you double those emotions.
the second kind is a life of engagement: working life, raising boys, your emotional life and your leisure time, and it was time for you.
like aristotle said.
and the third type is the same life.
and I like to tell you a little bit about those species and what we know about them.
good life is the first kind, and it simply is the best you can get, in which you get what you can, and a positive emotion to the extent that you can, learn skills and create a mentality that enables you to enjoy and multiply those emotions that extend to your time and place.
but the good life has three obstacles, and that's why psychology doesn't know happiness, and he doesn't care about her,
the first obstacle is that he made it clear that the good life, your experience with positive emotions, is capable of transfusions, about 50 % of them, but she's a neurotic on the amendment and that's true.
so the ways we know matthew ricard and others are about an increase in the positive emotions in your life by about 15 %, you get the destiny of her.
the second obstacle is that positive emotions get used to it and get used to it very quickly.
your emotions are more like a vanilla ice cream, you have a lot of fun in the first lick, but with the sixth game, this fun is evaporating.
and like I said, it's not good.
and this leads us to the second type of happy life.
and I have to tell you about my friend lane if I want to explain that positive psychology is more than a positive emotion, and more than just a study of what we enjoy.
in two of the three areas in lin's life and he's 30 years old, lin was so successful, the first area was his life.
when he was 20, he was working in trade.
when the 25-year-old became a millionaire and the head of a multi-list business company.
secondly, on the side of the game: where is my national hero in the bridge game?
love is the third area of his life, and he's a loser with all that means.
and the reason for that is that lin had been so emotional.
(laughs) lane's an antenna.
when he's dating american women, they pick him up, " your company's not fun. " you lack positive feelings, west of my face. "
and lin is rich enough to pay a first-class psychoanalyst, who tried to find a sexual knot in five years, which somehow prevented him from feeling positive.
but it turns out it wasn't a sexual complex.
it turns out lin grew up on long new york island playing football, playing bridge... takes a little less than 5 % of what we call positive emotional expression.
the question is: are lin unhappy? I want to say no.
contrary to what psychology tells us at least 50 % of the positive emotional expression of humans, I think lin is the happiest man I know.
they can not be held by misery and this is because lin - like most - is greatly able to move forward.
when he walks in the american stock exchange at 9:30 in the morning, time is in his favor and even the closing bell.
when the first paper is delivered until the end of ten days of competition, time is in favor of lin.
this is exactly what mike skiztenmali was talking about to go forward on a continuing basis as a significant reason for happiness.
happiness has three raw materials: it feels like it's happening, and it's an idea and also a feeling.
but mike told you yesterday he's in your progress, you don't feel anything.
when you listen to music, time stops.
and you have a good focus.
and that's exactly the most important thing we call life.
and we think there's a recipe for her, and he knows what your strengths are.
and again there's a good test that helps you figure out what's five points of your strength.
then how do you make your life take advantage of it?
you reform your emotional life, your games and your friendship, and your way of raising your children.
just an example: there was a girl working on her condition, she was working on the product of the gerindez stores.
she hated her job.
I managed to go to college.
and it was a social intelligence, so she redesigned that it works in the product of the product to reflect what this might mean to her that she has been represented for every operative of his daily dealings.
now it seems like it failed.
but what she did was she used her strengths and formed those powers to use her to work as much as you can.
what you get from that isn't smiling.
it's not the beauty of the american actress debbie reynolds.
don't knock it so much.
so this is the second route. the first is the positive passion.
the second path is the path of happiness.
and the third route is the meaning.
and the meaning of life is a kind of happiness, traditionally.
and the meaning of that body consists of... and it is very consonant with happiness, composed of your knowledge of your maximum powers, and using them to belong and serve something bigger than you.
you mentioned those three types of life, happy, good, life, and people who work hard to answer the question, are there things that can make a final change to those three species?
and the answer seems to be yes, and I'll give you samples of what we've reached.
and very precise work has been worked out.
the same way we test drugs to see what the useful drug is.
so we do a random examination, control the playboy agent and long-term studies on various interventions.
for a sample of those interventions that we find an impact, when people know happy life, in the sense of how they get more happiness in their lives, one of your tasks is to take your mind skills and your abilities to taste and ask you to plan a happy day.
the next saturday, he set up a day and plans to be happy, use your intellectual skills and shake your mind to improve what he hears on that day.
and that way we can show that happy life has improved.
I want you all to do this with me now if you let me.
close your eyes.
I want you to remember someone who did a very important job and changed your life to a better direction, someone who probably never thanked him.
this guy has to be alive, okay?
now, okay, you can open your eyes.
I hope you all have been able to remember this guy.
your job when you pay a visit, you write a paragraph of 300 words as a testimony to this guy, you call him, if he's in phoenix, and ask him if you can visit him, don't tell him why, and you're on his door, read him what I wrote about him.
what happens is that when we test people a week or a month or three months, we find them more happy and less depressed.
another example is a date for the force, in which we bring a couple and determine their strengths on the power test measure, and we design an evening design that each of them uses their strengths, and we find this one of the factors to strengthen the relationship.
and fun for charity.
but your heart blows so hard when you're in a group like this, when many of you turn his life into charity work.
well, my students and the people I work with didn't find out, actually, we make people do business and do fun, and we meet that with you.
and what you find out is that you have done a funny job, decreasing the trail and back for what you were.
and when you do a charity job, it lasts and goes on.
and that's how you have examples of positive interventions.
the next thing I'd like to tell you is that we're interested in people's satisfaction with their lives.
and it's what you really seek, and it's also our goal of diversity.
and we ask the question as a common element between three different types of life, how much satisfaction do you feel about your life?
so we ask - and we did 15 times by involving thousands of human beings - how much the quest for happiness, behind the positive emotions, the happy life, the engagement, the use of your life, and the composition of the meaning of your life?
and our results surprised us, unlike what we thought.
it turns out that the quest for happiness is not contributing to the degree of satisfaction of life.
the search for the meaning was the strongest.
and the engagement is also very strong.
when it doesn't matter only happiness, if you have both the connection and the meaning, happiness is like a scrambled butter with cherry.
in other words, full life, everyone is bigger than his entire parts, if you have three parts.
on the contrary, if you don't have any of the three, the empty life will be less than the whole parts.
and what do we ask now is, is the same relationship, physical health and the prevalence of the disease, how old will you live with the same level of productivity, and follow the same relationship?
which is the cooperation, is productivity indicative of positive passion, association and meaning?
is health a sign of good association, and the meaning of life?
and there's a reason to think that the answer to these questions is: yes.
so chris told me that the previous records had a chance to merge what he heard, and that's amazing for me, and I've never been in a gathering like this.
I haven't seen lecturers do things that are unorthodox, which was one of the special things.
but I found that psychology problems seem to be consistent with the technical, entertainment and design problems as follows.
we all know that the technology, entertainment and design have used and can be used for destruction purposes.
we also know that the technology, entertainment and design can be used in the treatment of tragedies.
by the way, the difference between the treatment of tragedy and the construction of happiness is very important.
I thought 30 years when I became a therapist, that if I was good enough to make a human being rid of his shoulders, his stress and his anger, I'd make him happy.
I found out that the best you can reach is zero level.
their lives were empty.
it turns out that happiness skills and happy life, engagement skills, composition and sense are quite different from the treatment of tragedies.
and the same thing continues to rule the technology, entertainment and design, I think.
those three things can be engines of our world to increase positive emotions, happiness, and that's exactly what they used.
but whenever happiness is all over my way, not only to positive emotions - that's never enough - there's a path of life, and there's a meaning for life.
as we've learned from laurel, design, and I think entertainment and technology can be used to increase the meaning and association in life, too.
so, from all this, 11 reasons for optimism, in addition to the space elevator is that it's technical, design and entertainment, I think, we can actually increase the amount of human happiness on this planet.
and if the technology in the next decade can increase happy life, the good life and the emotional sense, that would be good enough.
if the entertainment world can be fun to increase positive emotions, happiness and meaning will be good enough.
if the design can increase positive emotions, happiness, the flow and meaning, what we do together will make us good enough.
basically, there's a major demographic event going on now.
50 percent in urban areas that represent an economic turning point can cross the world, now the world is a map of communication.
paris, london and new york were the biggest cities.
what we have now is the end of the west. it's over.
the total numbers are huge.
well, the world's villages are empty now.
the question is, why?
and this is the unromantic truth - and the city's air makes you free to say in germany, even some people go to places like shanghai, but most of them go to random cities where beauty is ruled out.
and these aren't really people who are vulnerable to poverty.
they're people out of poverty as fast as they can.
they're the majority of the builders and so much, most designers.
they have homemade infrastructure and a vital urban life.
one sixth of india's gross domestic product comes from bombay.
they're constantly evolving, and in a few cases, the government is helping them.
education is the main event in cities.
what's going on in the main streets of mumbai?
the gore knows, actually, everything happens.
there's no unemployment in random cities.
human sixth is there, and soon you'll be more than that.
so this is the first punch that the cities have removed the population bomb.
and here's the second punch.
here's the news from downtown. here in the views.
the stars have heard the lives of the earth for billions of years.
now we're on the contrary.
thank you.
these rocks have been hit by the planet for about three billion years, and they are responsible for much of what happened on our planet.
this is an example of a real meteor stone, you can watch iron blossoms from speed and heat when the meteor hits the ground, and to what extent it's left and melting.
from meteors to space, and we're here with the original esputnik.
this is one of the seven survivors that haven't been released into space.
that's not a copy.
the space era began 50 years ago in october, and that's exactly how it looked like asbestos.
it would not be fun to talk about the space era without seeing the flag that was carried to the moon and back, on apollo 11.
each astronauts carried about 10 flags of silk in their personal bags.
they will be returned and preserved.
so this is actually carried to the moon and returned.
so this is for fun.
books, of course, mission.
it would not be interesting to talk about the beginnings of books without getting angel gtenberg.
you can notice how practical and easy it was to have your own version of gttenberg in 1455.
but exciting about angel gtenberg is the beginnings of this technology, not the book.
you see, the book wasn't driven by reading.
1455, someone can't read.
then why did the print pass?
this is an original page of angel gtenberg.
so you're looking here to one of the first printed books using some kind of transfer from human history, 550 years ago.
we are now living in the era of the end of the books, where electronic papers have undoubtedly replaced their place.
but why is that so important?
it turns out that in 1450 years, the catholic church wanted money, so they printed tars - in fact, they wrote their hands these things called tessale, which are the instruments of paper.
all over europe and sold by hundreds or thousands.
they get you out of agony faster.
when the print was inventoried, they were able to print the leniency, which was rewarded with the printing of money.
therefore, all western europe began to purchase 1455 printers to print thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of dollars and then eventually millions to a small piece of paper that brings you out of hell to heaven.
for that reason, the printers were successful, and that is why martin luther presented his ninetieth thesis to the door because he complained that the catholic church had gone crazy and sold it in every city and village throughout western europe.
if the print, ladies and gentlemen, was primarily driven by the printing of forgiveness and had nothing to do with reading.
more tomorrow, too. I have pictures from the library to hurt those who asked about the pictures.
we'll show each other tomorrow.
(applause) instead of showing the thing from the platform, I'll do something special for the first time.
we'll show, actually, what the library looks like, okay?
so, I'm married to the greatest woman in the world.
we'll know why this is in a minute, 'cause when I went to meet eileen, that's what I said I wanted to build.
this is a human imagination library.
the same room is three floors tall.
in glass panels, five thousand years of human imagination controlled through the computer.
the room is a theatre.
all parts of the library are different, different distances.
I designed like an escher print.
here's some bottom of the library where the exhibits are constantly changing.
we can walk through it. you can touch it.
you can see how many types of these things can fit a room.
this is my saturation planet.
well, if you can see the bottom part of the library here, books and exhibits.
all the glass plates, it's some kind of fantasy history.
there's a glass bridge you can walk through that hanging in the void.
so it's a leap in imagination.
so how do we start?
part of the question I have answered is that we should let ourselves be surrounded by incentives, human achievements, history, with things that move us and make us human. emotional discovery, dinosaur bones before a long time ago, the horrendous maps we have experienced, and eventually the corridors that stimulate our minds and imagination.
so, I hope I show you tomorrow, one or two of these things on the stand, but for the day, I wanted to say thank you for all the people who came and talked to us about it.
I am very happy to open our house and share it with ted society.
(applause) ted revolves around patterns in the clouds.
it's all about communication.
it's all about seeing things that everybody has ever seen, but think about it in ways that no one ever touched.
and that's all about the discoveries and imagination.
for example, we can see the dna model here.
none of us actually saw this before, but we know it exists because we've been taught to understand why this molecules.
but we can also look at the anigma of nazis in the second world war, a machine that is encrypted and decoded.
now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?
well, this is the code of life, and this is the death code.
these two parts are encrypted and decoded.
so far, look at them, you can see a machine and a particle.
but once I see you in a modern way, you realize that each of these things is already connected.
and they're basically connected to this here.
you see, this is a human brain model, okay?
and it's rare, because we didn't get to see a brain.
we got to see the skull, but that's it.
all imagination, everything we think, we feel it, feel it, come across the human brain.
once we create a new pattern in this brain, once we have the brain in a new way, it will never come back to his original form.
I will give you a quick example.
we think about the information going through the internet.
we never thought of hidden calls.
but I brought here a piece of coal - here, one piece of coal.
and what is the relationship of coal with the internet?
you follow, it takes a piece of coal to move megabite from the information across the grid.
so every time you download a file, every megabite is a piece of coal.
what that means, a 200 megabyte file sounds like this, ladies and gentlemen, okay?
so next time you're pregnant, or two gigabytes, it's not free, okay?
the relationship is the energy you consume to run the web and to make everything we think it's possible, possible.
thanks, chris.
(applause) I've made the slide show I've offered for two years more than 2,000 times.
well, I'm not trying and I don't need it, but I'm actually trying to simplify it.
because I made it quick in an attempt to confront the challenge of this meeting.
it reminded me of the great offer by karen armstrong that the well-understood religion is not about the belief, but by behaviour.
maybe we should say the same thing about optimism.
how serious are we to be optimistic?
sometimes optimism is described as a belief or a think attitude.
and as hatma gandhi said, " you must be the change you'd like to see in the world. "
the outcome we hope to be optimistic about by believing only if it is a reason for new behaviour, but I think that the word " conduct " sometimes misunderstood in this context.
I'm a senior advocate to change lighting lights, buy multitech devices and clocks, so I put 33 solar boards above the house, and I dug the thermal wells and other things like that.
changing lighting lights is important, but most importantly, it's changing the rules.
when we change our behaviour in everyday life, sometimes we lose sight of the part of citizenship and the part of democracy. in order to be optimistic about this, our activity must be enormous as citizens of our democracy.
so that we can solve the climate crisis, we need to solve the problem of democracy.
applause, and we're suffering from this problem.
and I tried to make this clear over and over again.
and lately, she reminded me of that, a lady who passed the table I was sitting on and was staring at her. she was in the '70s, and she looked like good marks. I didn't think about her until I saw her in my eyes walking from the opposite direction and she was staring at me.
and she said, " you know, if your hair painted black, you're gonna be the whole gore. " (laughs) several years ago, when I was a young deputy congress, I spent a very long time in facing the challenge of nuclear weapons control - the nuclear arms race - the nuclear arms race - the nuclear arms race.
military historians during this search have taught me that military conflicts are divided into three items: local fighting and regional wars, and world wars that are rare but most important, as they are strategic conflicts.
each level of conflict requires different resources, a different approach and a different organizational model.
environmental challenges can be classified into three similar categories that most of what we think is local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution and hazardous waste dumps, but there are also regional environmental problems, such as acid rain from the midwest to the north-east, from western europe to the arctic region, and from the middle west region outside mississippi to the dead area of the gulf of mexico.
there are many of these problems, but the climate issue is the most rare but most important at the same time as it is a global or strategic conflict.
everything is affected by the climate crisis, so we need to address it properly, we need a global international mobilization for renewable energy, maintenance and efficiency, and a global transformation towards a less dependent economy based on carbon component.
we have work to do, and we can mobilize resources and political will, but the political will must first be mobilized so that resources will be mobilized.
let me introduce you to these photographers here.
I thought I'd start the logo. what's the missing thing here, of course, is the ice cover for the northern pole.
the remains of greenland island 28 years ago, this was the form of polar ice cover - the arctic ice cover at the end of the summer at the time of the autumn moderation.
last autumn, I went to the ice and ice data center in boulder, colorado, and spoke to researchers here in the city of monterrey in the marine studies laboratory.
that's what happened over 28 years ago.
to see it from the right perspective, 2005 was the previous record.
and here's what happened last fall, which was discouraged by the search of the researchers.
the arctic ice cover is the same geographic size as it doesn't seem like the same size, but the size of the united states is quite the size of an area that is almost equal to arizona.
the part that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of mississippi.
the additional amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this big size, which is also due in the winter, but not in the form of permanent ice, but a small ice that is subject to disappearance. the remaining amount can disappear in the summer in a period of not more than five years.
and that's a lot of pressure on greenland.
this is a small town in alaska, a small city in new zealand.
the amount of ice melting between the average and the limit of the size of the california size.
 these were the best times, and these were the worst times,  the most recent opening in english literature. I would like to mention in short the " planet planet. " the earth and venus have almost the same size.
and they're exactly the same carbon.
but the difference is that, on the ground, the majority of carbon has been used outside the atmosphere and deposited into the ground in the form of coal, oil, natural gas, etc., on venus, most of the carbon is in the atmosphere. the difference is that our temperature is 59 on average.
and that's not because venus is a little closer to the sun.
his temperature is three times higher than the temperature of mercury next to the sun, and now, in short, this is a picture you've seen as one of the rare old pictures, but I offer it because I want to give you an investigation into the climate of the climate.
the world scientific assembly says that the pollution caused by anthropogenic global warming, which is exported to the atmosphere, which causes its intensification, is working to hold more infrared emissions.
you all know that, and in the latest summary of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, scientists wanted to say " to what extent you are confident? " they wanted to answer " 99 percent. "
the chinese were opposed, the agreement was " over 90 percent. "
now, the skeptics say, " wait, maybe that's differences in this energy coming from the sun. " if that's true, the upper layer of atmosphere, as well as the lower atmosphere of the atmosphere, if she's heading inside more,
if she's on the way, she's expected to be warmer, and be more cold here, here's the lower layer of the atmosphere.
here's the upper layer of atmosphere: more cold.
csi: climate
now, here's the good news. 68 % of americans believe that human activity is responsible for global warming. 69 % believe that the land is increasing dramatically. there's progress, but here's the key to the puzzle: when a list of challenges is given, global warming is near the last list.
what we miss is a feeling of the urgent need for that.
if you agree with the analysis based on the facts, but you don't have a feeling of the urgent need, where do you get that?
well, the alliance for the protection of climate, which I chaired in cooperation with the correnttv channel - which did so for the common good, conducted a public competition for advertising on how to publish it.
that's the winner.
nbc - all networks here - senior journalists of the nbc have asked 956 questions in 2007 for presidential candidates: two questions on the climate issue - 844 questions, two of them on the climate issue
fox: two questions. cnn: two questions. cbs: 0
this is one of the oldest tobacco ads.
and here's what we do.
this is the consumption of gasoline in all this country, and this is our country's consumption.
but it's not just the developed countries.
the developing countries are now following and accelerating their mistakes. their accumulated emissions this year are equivalent to what we have been in 1965. they are in large numbers. gross concentrations: by 2025, they will reach what we were in 1985.
if the rich states disappear from the picture, we'll keep suffering from this case.
but we gave developing countries the technological means and ways of thinking, so that this case is in bolivia over 30 years.
it's been so fast. this is in the 1960s.
in the 1970s, in the '80s, in the 1990s, we must stop it, and the good news is that we can.
we have technological means.
we must have a common view on how to address these issues: conflict with poverty in the world challenge reducing emissions produced by rich states, all of which have a single and very simple solution.
people say, " what's the solution? " here's the solution.
we need a carbon dioxide tax. we need a co2 tax, which is neutral for the return to replace taxes on employment, which has been invented by customs. some things have now changed since the 19th century.
in the poor world states, we need to integrate poverty solutions with solutions to the climate issue.
poverty eradication plans in uganda are controversial if we do not solve the climate issue
solutions can make a big difference in poor countries. this is a suggestion that has been made in europe.
this was from the " nature " magazine, focusing on renewable solar plants linked to the so-called electricity company, supergrad, to produce electricity necessary for europe, in large part from developing countries.
it's not just talk, it can be implemented.
we need to do it for our economy.
the old statistics show that the old model doesn't fit. there are many investments you can do if you're invested in tar sand or stone oil, so you have a wallet that is embedded in subcarbon assets.
and she's based on an old model.
they're looking for the orbits in their fingers when their arms are gone and their legs go away.
and I have a stake in that, so I'm going to declare my responsibility out there.
but advanced solar voltage, efficiency and maintenance
you've seen this chip before, but there's a change.
the only two states that haven't agreed and now there's only one election in australia.
there was a campaign in australia that contained television spots and through the internet and radio to raise the sense of urgency for people there.
we trained 250 people to offer presentations in every city and village in australia.
many other things have been involved, but the new prime minister announced that his first priority would be to change australia's position on kyoto, and now they have been partially aware of the severe drought they have suffered.
this is lake lanier, my friend heidi colens said that if we launch names of dehydration, as we call cyclones, we'll call the drought in the southeast now, katarina, and we'll say he's headed to atlanta.
we can't wait for this kind of drought. australia should have changed our political culture.
and here's more good news. the number of cities that support kyoto in the united states is more than one.
I think I've seen one on her way to join only to take it, which is a good news.
and now let's seal it up, we've heard two days ago of the value of making the individual championship a regular thing to become a regular or routine thing.
what we need is another generation of heroes between us in the united states of america today, but also on the rest of the world to understand to some extent that history gave us a choice - just like jill bolt taylor was trying to find how she could save her life when she was attracted to the remarkable experience she passed.
now we have a culture of distracting attention.
but we have a planetary crisis.
we have to find a way to create a generation that lives between us today, feeling the obvious mission.
I hope I've been able to tell what I want.
that was another generation of heroes that brought democracy to the planet.
another generation of heroes ended slavery. another gave women the right to vote.
don't tell me we don't have the power to do it.
if we spend one week worth of what we spend in the iraq war, we can make achievements on our way to solve this challenge.
we have the ability to do that.
one last point, I'm optimistic because I believe that we have the ability, in moments that are a great challenge, to avoid the causes of distractions and stand up to this challenge of history ahead of us.
sometimes I hear people answer the tragic facts about the climate issue by saying, " that's terrible. "
what kind of burden do we have to ask you to think about it differently? how many generations in the history of mankind have the chance to stand up to this challenge that needs to be done with our utmost efforts?
I think we should address this challenge with a sense of great happiness and gratitude because we are the generation of thousands of years now, from now of the orchestra, the blonde, the trolls, and they say they were the ones who found themselves the ability to solve this issue and lay the foundation for an optimistic and exhilarating human future.
thank you very much.
chris anderson suffers from deep pain, which is basically a design issue - and at the end of the matter, a design issue in the form of a vote - a bad design issue means that your voice wasn't as far as the last eight years in the last eight years.
that hurts.
when you look at what senior candidates do now, you have no idea what this is, you're excited about their global warming plans?
al gore: the answer to this question is difficult for me because, on the one hand, we must be very happy because both the republican candidate - a certain candidate - john mccain, each of the final candidates of the democratic party - has a completely different position and help advance the climate issue. each of the three has presented the leadership and each of them is completely different from the current management approach. I believe that they have been responsible for submitting plans and proposals.
this event, which was compiled by the conservative voters association on this occasion, analysis of all questions - and by the way, all the debates were sponsored by something that was in line with the braille of " clean field. "
each match was sponsored by clean field.
 now, less emissions! 
the fact that dialogue and debate in our democratic country has been filled has not laid the foundation for the kind we need from the clear initiative.
so they say the right things, and perhaps whatever the elected ones - might do the right thing, but let me tell you: when I came back from kyoto in 1997, I had a great feeling that we made progress here, and then the us senate had only one out of 100 members who wanted to vote for confirmation, to ratify the convention.
this challenge is part of our civilization's fabric.
carbon dioxide is the ambassador of our civilization, literally.
and now we're putting up mechanisms for this process. changing pattern requires scope, scope and speed of change beyond what we've been in the past.
so I've never said we have to be optimistic about what we do, and we have to be active citizens.
request... change lighting lights, but we have to change the rules.
we have to solve this case, we're suffering from our democracy, and we have to change that.
use the internet. go to the internet.
contact people. you have to become a good citizen.
we must have no coal production plants that can not control co2 and storage, which means we should build these renewable sources quickly.
now, nobody talks about this scope, but I think between now and november, it's possible.
the alliance for the protection of climate will launch a united states nationwide campaign - the mobilization of popularity, television advertisements, online advertisements, radio and newspapers - in partnership with all from girls' camps, even snipers and fishermen.
we need help. we need help.
chris anderson, as far as your role is advanced, is there anything more you'd like to do?
al gore, I called to be able to find the solution to this issue.
 if the future of all mankind stands for me, what can I do? 
it depends on all of us, but again, not just by light bulbs.
we, most of us here, americans, we have a democratic country.
we can change things, but we need to change it effectively.
what we really need is to achieve a higher level of awareness.
and that's a hard thing to accomplish - but we're on the way to him.
there's an old african saying that some of you say, " if you want to walk fast, walk on your own, and if you want to go someplace far away, they'll walk together. " we have to go somewhere further and fast.
we have to have a change in consciousness.
a new sense of urgency.
assessment of the privilege we are unique if we address this challenge
chris anderson, al gore, thank you so much for coming to tid.
thank you very much.
(applause) (music) (applause) anyway, this is about the evil of science, so I think it's perfect.
# oh, if I have to walk, who thought I could look so good # # I'm talking on the phone with my clone # # we're all friends, 'cause we're not alone, 'cause we're not alone, 'cause we're not alone. we can survive, side by side, mother nature, don't call it a liar, it's my clone.
# he was rich, but it wasn't nobody to be with me. # # look who's born to me. # # away from bankruptcy, and rich people, we don't need any natural zeroes - # # our children are becoming a growing, so I'm so tired. " we can say that cancer cells are more intimate than phil spector. we'll be able to survive side by side, I have to sing with the vitality instead of sonny. "
♫ you're my clone. ♫ " oh, how much I love you, my clone. "
 oh, the only person I loved is me. 
# j, this swelling, I think you're just a attraction to a killer, you're my clone.
(applause) welcome.
we both are here to give you an example of creativity.
where I'm gonna form one of robert lang's models.
and this is the piece of paper that I'm going to form from her, and you can see all the necessary riches.
and rufus is going to make some improvisation on his five-hour electric cello machine, and it's fun to listen to him.
are you ready?
and to make it more interesting.
all right, let's start, rufus.
okay, here she is.
(laughs) when I first arrived in the beautiful zimbabwe, it was hard to understand that 35 percent of its population had aids.
it was hard until I was invited to the people's homes, and then I began to understand the human toll of this plague.
for example, this is harbert with his grandmother.
when I first met them, he was sitting in his grandma's lap.
he was an orphan, where his parents died because of aids and his grandmother even died of aids.
he loved sitting in her lap because he said it hurts for him to lie down on his bed.
when his grandmother made tea, I put him in my lap, and I never felt a child in such a deer.
before I left, I asked him if he wanted something.
I thought he'd ask a doll or a candy bar, but he asked for a call because he said his feet were cold.
this is joyce, who's in this picture.
single mother, aids.
her picture was before and after her beautiful child, isa.
and I've been wandering last week on lavati street in manhattan, and I got a call from a woman I don't know, but she called to tell me that joyce died from the age of 23.
joyce's mother now took care of her baby like a lot of other zimbabwe children who died because of the epidemic.
and this is a few stories.
but with any picture, there are people who have a whole life and stories that deserve to talk.
all these pictures from zimbabwe.
chris anderson, christine, just in one minute to tell us your story about how you got to africa.
- christine ashburn. - oh, my god.
well, at that time I was working, in production for fashion imaging.
and I read the new york times, and I went in statistics, numbers.
she was so scary.
so I quit my job, and I decided this is the case I want to deal with.
in fact, I went to botswana first, where I spent a month - that was in december 2000 - and then I went to zimbabwe for a month and a half, and I went back in march 2002 for a month and a half again in zimbabwe.
this is an amazing story, thank you.
- thank you. - I have a chance to offer.
there's only one way to change our genes, and it's making new genes, as craig venter offered in a little bit earlier.
the other way is to change our lifestyle.
as we saw how touching that change is, you don't have to wait a long time to see the score.
when you eat healthy food and deal with pressures and exercise sports and love, that makes your brain more blood and oxygen.
but more than that, your brain cells are clearly increasing.
in the past few years, it was impossible to measure it right now.
robin williams found that a few years ago from the rest of us.
these are some things you can do to make your brain earn new cells.
some of my favorite things like chocolate, tea and alcohol are moderation and deal with pressures in marijuana.
I'm just a messenger.
(laughs) where are we?
(laughs) other things make him worse, and he may cause a loss of brain cells.
usually accused, like saturated fat, nicotine sugar, opium, cocaine and over-alcoholic alcohol.
your skin gets more blood when you change your lifestyle, so you're breaking less fast and not leaving your skin fast.
your heart gets more blood.
we see you can overcome heart disease.
those blocked arteries at the top of the screen, one year later, have become remarkably low.
so is the radiator at the bottom of the blue screen. it means there's no blood.
after a year, orange and white is the maximum flow of blood.
so you can stop and reverse the deterioration of pancreatic cancer in his first stages, as well as breast cancer by simply doing these things.
we also found that the tumor grew in 70 % of the people who made these changes, and only 9 % in other people.
and this difference is of great importance.
as well as the reproductive system, he'll get a bigger amount of blood and increase sexual capacity.
one of the most effective anti-smoking commercials did the job (health service) show nicotine, narrow your blood, could cause a heart attack or stroke, and might cause a sexual disability as well.
half of the smokers are sexually incapacitated.
how exciting does that sound?
right now, we're about to publish a study explaining that we can change the dna of someone with prostate cancer.
this is the so-called heat map, and these different colors on the right side are different genes.
we found more than 500 jane doe, in fact, activation of the good genes, those that prevent the disease and stop the work of the gene that causes the disease.
and these results are very strong, as I believe and give many people a new hope and new choices.
companies like negajenks, and you've turned the dna and the 23 and mi, which gives you your genetic map, give some people a sense of " oh, my god, what can I do about it? "
well, our genes are not our destiny, if we do these changes, there will be a willingness, but if we make bigger changes, we can make it different.
thank you.
applause. I've been here for about four years. I'm talking about the relationship of the art of happiness.
at the end of the lecture, a list was presented under this heading.
I've only learned a very few things since then - (laughs) but I've done it all in projects after that.
these are inflatable monkeys in every city in scotland. " everybody always thinks he's right. "
collected in the media.
 medicine is at first fun, but it becomes a burden later. 
we're changing the media.
that's a show. you can see the scenes when the scenes go through.
he's got to rip the spider out.
all these things are parts of your surgical design.
half of them for our clients.
commissioned by them.
I would never have enough money to pay for her composition or to pay the value of the billboards or the value of production, there's always a client to take care of.
there are 65,000 coats of coats on a street full of fashion shops.
 fear doesn't solve anything. 
 money doesn't make me happy,  she showed up first on two full pages in a magazine.
the printer lost the file, and she didn't tell us.
when actually, when I received the number, there were 12 pages.
you say, " money makes me happy. "
a friend of mine in austria, he felt sorry for me, and I convinced your biggest casino in the city of linz to let us wrap his building.
this is the main infantry area in linz.
and she just says " money, " and if you look at the side street, you say, " don't make me happy. "
we had a show in new york last week.
we had the windows out of the window, and every hour he was entering a different designer and wrote those things he learned on the steam windows.
everyone participated, milton glaser.
singapore was in debate.
this is a small spot that we filmed up there to be exposed to the top of the big show, " jumburons " in singapore.
and, of course, that's his heart on my heart, because of all these emotions, some of them were simple, some were a little deeper, all of which came out of my day.
and I go back to my journal and see if I want to change something about the situation.
if she's... seeing her for a long time, including enough, I actually do something about her.
the last project is a billboard.
this is our roof in new york, the studio surface.
these are manuscripts lying on paper print paper.
we left it under the sun.
as you all know, paper print paper turns yellow on the sun.
a week later, we removed manuscripts and leaves, we shipped paper paper to lisbon in a sunny spot, on the first day, the billboard says, " the complaint is silly. "
three days later, she's got her color, a week later, no more complaint anyway.
(laughs) thank you so much.
50 years ago in the old soviet union, a team of engineers transported a large body across the abandoned countryside.
they hoped to take the minds of humans everywhere to be the first to open space.
the rocket was huge.
stuffed in his nose, silver ball inside a radio.
on the fourth of october 1957, they fired their missile.
one of the russian scientists wrote then we're about to make a new planet, which we're gonna call it sputnik.
in the old days, explorers like vasco da gamma and columbus are lucky to open the globe.
now we have luck to open space.
we're gonna have to do that. those who come in the future.
you watch the scraps of sputnik, my fifth documentary, which is about to be completed.
he's talking about the story of sputnik and the story of what happened in america as a result.
for days after the launch, sputnik was a gesture of interest.
a moon of human beings can see it and the horror and pride that humans have finally unleashed a body into space.
but only three days later, on a day called monday red, journalists and politicians told us, and believe them, sputnik is proof that our enemy has caused us in science and technology, and that they are now able to attack us with hydrogen bombs using sputnik missiles.
and you didn't sit there.
sputnik quickly became one of the three trauma that america says of historians, it's pearl harbor and september 11.
he raised the missile gap.
blow up the gun race.
the space race started.
in a year, congress funded huge arms increases and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000.
the reaction went far beyond the increase of the weapon.
for example, some here mention this day, june 1958, experimenting with national civil defense, where tens of millions of people are headed in 78 underground cities.
or a visual poll that showed seven of every 10 americans believed a nuclear war would start and at least 50 percent of the population would kill.
but sputnik has made great changes as well.
for example, some in this room went to school with a scholarship because of your sputnik.
engineering support, mathematics and science in general.
vincent cerf explains that sputnik led directly to the advanced research project agency, the internet and of course nasa.
it explains my documentaries how a free society can drive through those who know the use of the media.
but it also makes it clear how we can turn what it looks like at first as a bad situation to something that's pretty good for america.
sputnik will be released soon.
in conclusion, I'd like to take a minute to thank one of the investors from ted's old leader, jay walker.
and I would like to thank you all.
(applause)
thanks, chris.
well, I'm involved in other things besides physics.
actually, most likely now in other things.
one thing is the distance between the human languages.
and the pros in the united states.
in western europe, most of them have tried to stay away from any relationship that has a long distance ; large gatherings come back to a long time longer than known families.
they don't like it, they think it's a freak. I don't think it's a freak.
and there are some creative language, most of them, russians working on that at santa fe institute and in moscow, and I'd like to see where this leads.
will he really lead to one advances in about 20, 25,000 years?
what if we go back to this one advances when he was there - supposed to be competition between many languages?
how long is this going to be?
how many tens of thousands of years come back?
chris anderson, do you have a feeling or hope of what the answer is?
moray gil-man, I'm guessing the modern language should be older than the drawings on the cave walls, the statues in the caves, the dance steps and the soft mud in the caves in western europe in the european period about 35,000 years ago, or before that.
I can't believe they did all this, and they didn't have a modern language.
so I can guess that the primary origin is this far, and maybe further.
but this doesn't mean that all, many, or most of the untested languages, haven't descended from a smaller language, to say 20,000 years or something, that's what we call the bottle of the bottle.
well, maybe philip anderson was right.
maybe you know more about everything than anyone.
thank you, moray gil-man.
[applause] chris enson: william, hi. nice to meet you.
willem camcumba: thank you.
if we have a picture, I think, where is this?
this is my house where I live.
what state?
and, like, in malawi, casonjo.
well, now you're 19, aren't you?
yeah, I'm 19 now.
like five years ago, you had an idea.
and, like, I wanted to make a windmill.
like a windmill?
and, like, yeah.
so, what - energy - for lighting and stuff?
and, like, yeah.
how did you do that?
and, like, after I got out of school, I went to the library and read a book about energy use, and I got the information to make it.
and I tried and made it.
if we copy, I copy the design as in the book.
and, like, uh, no, I'm just like... what happened?
in fact, the design of windmill in the book was four - ah, three feathers and my flight four feathers.
the book has three and you have four.
and, like, yeah.
what did you make?
and, like, I made four feathers, just because I wanted to increase energy.
okay.
and, like, yeah.
did you try three, and I found that four works better?
and, like, yeah, I tried.
what made the mill?
what - the materials you used?
I used a bike frame, a ball, plastic tubes, and then you pull like, " do we have a picture of that? " would you show the next chip?
yeah, the windmill.
so, this mill, what - did you work?
and, like, when the wind blows, it turns up and generates.
how much energy?
and, like, 12 watts.
so, this is the whole house?
and... four to a bar and a radio yen.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
and, like, yeah.
so, uh, so... (applause) - the next chip of this?
and, like, these are my parents, get the radio.
how did they react? I was 14 or 15, so what was their reaction?
and, like, yeah.
