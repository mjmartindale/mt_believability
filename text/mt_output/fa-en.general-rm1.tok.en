allison hunt , i have n't started three minutes , has it ?
no , you ca n't start three minutes from the beginning .
zero time . it 's not fair .
oh , my god , it 's so cruel up here !
i mean , i 'm just as nervous and nervous as i am .
but not as long as i was five weeks ago .
five weeks ago , i had a full hip replacement surgery .
do you know anything about this surgery ?
the drill and chainsaw , completely disgusting , unless you 're david banlinski , in which case it will be quite beautiful and lovely .
yes , david , when there 's no surgery on your hip , it 's beautiful .
anyway , in this situation , i realized something big and important , and chris invited me to say it for you .
but before that , you should know two things about me .
two points .
i am canadian and i am the youngest child of the seven children .
well , in canada , we have an excellent medical system .
i mean , we get our new hip free .
and since i was the youngest member of the family , i 've never been in line for anything , right ?
so , my hip has been sore for years .
i finally went to the doctor , which was free .
and he introduced me to a bone surgeon that was free .
- i finally saw that doctor after 10 months . - almost a year .
that 's a free problem !
i saw the surgeon , and he took a few free radiology photos of me , and i looked at them well , and , you know , i could see that my hip had a lot of problems , and i was actually at marketing .
so he said , " allison , we need to take you to bed . "
i 'll change your hip . " about 18 months waiting for it .
18 months .
i 've waited 10 months and now i have to wait 18 months .
you know , it 's too long i 've been thinking about ted 's plan , and you know , it 's too long to think about ted 's plan .
my new hip wo n't be ready for this program .
my new hip wo n't be ready for ted tedberg 's program in africa .
my new hip wo n't be ready for ted 's program in 2008 .
i 'll still be with the hip hip , and it was hopeless .
thus , i came out of the office and went to the hospital , and that was when something started to spark .
this is the youngest family to find his way to the front of the line .
oh , yeah .
can i tell you how to do that from canada ?
we do n't think so .
we 're not talking about it , we do n't even think about it .
in fact , that 's how we find a canadian patriot on a journey .
" you go first . " oh , no , no , no , you first .
hey , you 're canadian ?
" great !
so that 's not how it works , suddenly i do n't hate to take any man away from perfect .
a 70 year old man who wants to play golf again with his hip replacement .
no , no , in front of the line .
so i was walking to the hospital until then , and i was in pain , because of my hip , and somehow i was looking for a sign .
and i saw a sign .
on a small gift glass , there was a sign that he wrote , " we need volunteers . "
well , they want me immediately .
there 's no such thing as necessary .
they were a candidate for volunteers because the average volunteer was at the hospital 75 years ago .
they needed young men .
well , the next thing you know , i have a heavenly blue vest on , id , and my 39th year , totally trained me .
i was working alone .
every friday morning , i was at the gift shop .
when i packed the hospital staff , i asked myself , " what are you doing ? "
then i 'd say , " well , i 'm gonna replace my hip . " after 18 months .
that 's great when my pain is over . "
all employees knew that bold and bold candidate .
my next appointment with the surgeon , by accident , was right after my shift at the gift store .
so normally , i had my vest and my id card .
i was very normal at the doctor 's office in the doctor 's office .
and you know , when he came in , i knew he saw them .
a few moments later , i took the surgery for a few weeks , and a long copy for percocet .
now , the word is that it was my volunteer work that actually took me to the front .
and , you know , i 'm not even ashamed of that .
two reasons .
first , i 'll take care of this piece of shit .
but yet i intend to continue voluntarily , what led me to the greatest expression .
even if he gets a canadian man in the system , he 'll do it to have an advantage for society .
hi , i want you to raise your hands and shake your hands like i am .
you can mimic things you see .
you can program thousands of muscles you have in your hands .
soon you 'll be able to see inside your head and plan , you can control the different brain parts you see over there .
i want to talk to you about this technology .
human years were willing to know what 's inside mind , and what human brain is going on .
well , thanks to the research labs , today , it 's been done for our generation .
people imagine this must be a very difficult thing to do .
they need to take a spaceship , dig it up and inject it into the bloodstream .
it 's dangerous to attack you in the aortic artery .
but we have a real technology to do this .
we want to have a trip to my partner peter 's brain .
this job will be done without any harm with m-arn .
we do n't need any injections or to advance radiation .
- we 're just gonna break into peter 's brain . - but the important thing is that we can look into his mind .
when peter moves his hand , that yellow stain you see , it 's a matter of fact that peter 's brain operation happens in it .
you 've seen that you can control the electrodes using electrodes , the image and the scans of the brain inside you .
the thing is , the analysis of this process would take months and months .
so peter could look right back when he was in the scanner 's scanner , so peter could look at his brain reactions .
he can see 65,000 active dots in his brain every second .
if he can see the pattern in his brain , he can learn to control it .
there are three ways to impress the brain , refer to a specialist , pill and surgical knife .
but soon the fourth solution will be yours .
we all know that when we think , these ideas create deep channels in our brain and brain .
for example , consider chronic pain , if you burn your hands , pain will put it back fast .
but if you suffer for six months or a year or a year , it means these circuits create pain that no longer works for you .
so if we can see the brain activity that produces pain , we can create 3-d models and see the brain processing process at the moment , and then based on our observations , we can identify the areas of the brain that are part of the pain .
now raise your hands and rise behind the arms .
now imagine you 'll be able to look inside your brain and choose the areas of the brain that do the exact same thing for you .
what you see here is that we have identified chronic pain channels in the patient 's brain .
however , it may shock you , but in fact , we 've been able to read this patient 's brain during surgery .
they can look at their brain activity , and they can control channels that cause pain .
they learn to harness this system so that he can generate anti-pain drugs .
when they do this , it 's on the upper side of the left , which is connected to the activities part of the brain that controls pain .
when they control their brains , they can control their pain .
this is research technology , but in our clinical trials , we have 44 % decreased in chronic pain .
you can only do this about yourself .
i 've seen inside my brain , you 'll be able to do it soon .
when you succeed , what would you like to control ?
you will be able to see a different aspect of your identity , which means your collection is your collection .
there are different grounds that we work on today , but i do n't have enough time to pay them off .
but i 'd like to discuss a very important question .
we will be the first generation capable of using this technology , human mind and brain .
the question is how we use it .
i had a review almost a year ago , a little over a year ago , from a high-ranking member of the department of defense in the department of defense .
who came to see me and said , " 1,600 of the children we sent out to fight back when they did n't have one . "
full hand of shoulder .
and we do the same thing before , and we do what we 've done from the civil war , a wood and a clip .
" and they deserve more than that . "
and he sat in my room in new hampshire , and he said , " i want you to give me something to attach to these kids , and they can put it in their mouths without knowing them . "
you know , he 's got emotional answers , and he can control his brain and send him to the brain .
he finally explained , " i 'm waiting for 300 pounds on paper , and he said , " that 's what i want from you . "
i said , " look , you 're crazy . this technology does n't exist . "
and that ca n't be done .
not in a hand , 21 degrees free , from shoulder to toe . "
he said , " about 12 of these 1600 people back now without two hands . "
you think it 's bad to lose a hand ?
" compared to losing both the pain . "
i had a day job , and my nights and weekends were full of things like , let the world water , and we trained the world , which , jesus , i do n't want to talk about .
i 'm constantly thinking about these poor kids .
he told me , " we 've done things all over the country . "
we 've got some amazing things in the neurology department . "
i said , " i 'll go on a research trip , see what you got . "
during the next month , i visited many places , some out of here , around the city , where i could find the best of the best .
i went to washington , i saw these kids , and i said , " i did what you asked me to do .
i still think you 're crazy , but not as much as i thought . "
i packed up a team , a little over 13 months ago , i collected about 20 odd men .
we said , " we 're gonna build a device that anyone wants to do with it . "
we 've created 14 degrees of liberty , freedom degrees at the end of the two final fingers .
we got this thing together .
two weeks ago , we hooked him up on walter reade , which unfortunately , today , he 's been seen on the news .
we showed it to some people .
someone who described himself lucky , because he was right and lost his left hand .
he sat on the table by 7-8 .
he said he was lucky because he had his good hand , and then he pulled himself off the table .
these kids have a way of thinking you ca n't believe it .
so i 'm gonna show you now without skin , a 30-second piece , and then i 'm done .
but , you see , what you 're looking at , we 've made enough of it so that he can measure a woman 's body so that we can put it on the body of all these people .
i 'm going to start what we only use in cat scans , and everything that 's good for them , to build a rubber tire , then put it on the next three , and kill it in 3-d .
so you do n't see all the interesting stuff inside this flexibility with 14 functions , each of the ability to feel the temperature and the pressure .
also , he has a new newton button that keeps him on , so the more he gets under the bar , the more it 's gonna stick .
they 'll take the bar , and he 'll be obedient again .
i 'm gonna show you guys a couple of simple things to do with us in washington , can you show us that , please ?
look at the way you get the fingers , the thumbs up , wrist .
that 's 6.9 pounds .
he wants to scratch his nose .
he has 14 degrees of freedom .
now he 's gonna take a pen with his thumb and thumb .
he 's putting him down now , a piece of paper , all the way in and out of the wrist and he reads it .
every day , i 'm an investor , i love missiles on weekends .
i like photography , i like the rockets , and i intend to talk to you about a hobby that can grow in years with children like these , children who grow up to love the missile , and eventually they might turn into a richard bronson .
my son designed a missile that was stable and stable , a missile in the shape of a golf ball , in my opinion this was a very interesting experiment , and he flew like a straight crossbow .
lemonade and vinegar .
the night toss is beautiful , in the valley of the great and the milky way .
two stage missiles , the missile cameras in their image , controls their flight computers , the gliders that return to earth .
i use roxy to simulate flights before they do , to see if they 're going to break the ultrasound , and then i 'll fly them along with intertwined computers .
but to throw so many big things , it has to go to the snow moor , the black rock , where dangerous things happen .
and the kids grow older , the missiles grow bigger , and they use the engines , they literally use the engines to amplify the missiles .
they take human beings to the lesbian and even the photographers also wonder when they see this glorious show .
these missiles use experimental engines like nitrogen oxide .
they used to use major pioneers .
it 's a strange kind of love .
we have a rockety-car website , including my photographs , if you want to know more about it , be a bystander .
we had to call him one-on-one .
this was so great , it went to 100,000 feet , but not quite ... actually , he went 11 feet deep into clay 's clay , and he was digging clay .
missiles get out of control for a long time , if you put a lot of followers in them .
it was a race race .
you can see what happened at night in a second , on the day we call these land sharks .
sometimes they explode in front of your eyes , or they fall in ultrasound .
to take this picture , i will do what i always do , and it is to go from the road to where no other audience is .
and if we can play this video , i 'll show you what happened to beethoven .
yeah , well done .
steve joroston , this is when they found out that the computer was down .
they cry to spread .
this place is when they realize that everything on the rocket is out of control .
sounds like he 's launching .
and i 'm gonna be quiet .
no .
up , up , up .
and that 's me . i 've been taking pictures all the time .
the more time it comes .
some people watch this program for nascap his sudden shock , his captors , and the parachute that burns down the last week .
this one went up , passed the ultrasound , got torn , decomposed in the sky , and came back a big metal piece .
these things fell during the last week , after the launch , after the next launch , after the next launch .
it 's an arrangement you ca n't imagine .
and in many ways , i 'm trying to record horrible things ... this is a shooting challenge when these things happen in seconds .
for things like this , joan of alabama comes to this place with video rays and video cameras , and it 's gonna make 100,000 feet go through the atmosphere .
- and it encourages the children to pursue rocket science and understand the significance of physics and mathematics , in many ways .
thank you .
unless we do something to get it or in 40 years , we 'll be facing an epidemic on a global scale .
a happy idea !
on this map of the countries they 're painted with blue over 20 % of their population is over 65 years .
this is the world we live in .
and this is the world that your children will live in .
over 12,000 years , the distribution of age in people 's population is something like a pyramid that the older ones are on top of it .
it started straight .
until 2050 will turn into a pillar , and then it starts to be reversed .
and that 's the reason for new episodes .
hope for life over 1840 is over twice , and right now it 's rising with 5 hours a day .
and the reason it 's not so good is , it 's , like , a 65 years of age , risk that you have alzheimer 's or parkinson 's .
in 2050 , 32 million people in america will be above 80 years , and if we do n't do anything about it , half of them will have alzheimer 's and three million more parkinson 's .
- right now , these diseases and other neurodiseases that we do n't have a cure for , the cost of a third of trillion dollars a year .
until 2050 , this will be over a trillion dollars .
alzheimer 's disease begins when the protein that needs to be properly formed and shaped in the shape of a rather majnu form .
so one of the ways we 're working on is the drug design you 've been working on to have molecular duct tape to keep protein in the right shape .
it 's preventing them from becoming the pitches that seem to destroy a large part of the brain .
it would be interesting to know that other neuropatients are affected by other parts of the brain , and there 's a way of eating the wrong ivy , and it shows that this method can be a way of treating a lot of neuropathy , not just for alzheimer 's .
also , there 's a strange relationship with cancer , because people with nervous patients rarely get a lot of cancer .
and this is the connection that a lot of people are currently following , but we 're very excited about it .
a lot of important things and all the creative work in this field have been funded by a private press .
and there are plenty of places that need more private help , because the government has taken its support , i 'm worried .
while we 're waiting for these things to happen , these are the things you can do .
if you want to reduce the risk to parkinson 's , caffeine will protect the species , no one knows why .
the damage to you is not good for you , they lead parkinson 's .
the avian flu is n't a good idea .
to protect you from alzheimer 's disease , it turns out that fish oil has affected the decreasing risk to azammer .
you also need to keep the blood pressure down because chronic blood pressure is the biggest factor factor for alzheimer 's .
it 's also the largest risk factor factor in the eye of the gl , which is actually alzheimer 's .
of course , when you see it , it comes or not , so you want to always be mentally prepared .
but hey , you 're listening to me .
so this is it .
and last thing you wish for people like me , good luck , all right ?
because time is for all of us .
thank you .
good morning .
let 's give you a minute to the biggest face of my bangerness , leonardo da vinci .
we 're all familiar with his extraordinary work . design , paintings , and his writings .
but we do n't know his face .
thousands of books have been written about him , but he 's still talking about his face .
even this famous portrait is unapproved by a lot of mordecai .
so what do you think ?
is this the image of leonardo da vinci or not ?
let 's find him .
leonardo is the one who drew everything around him .
he 's people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscape , buildings , water , and everything .
but he did n't kill his face ?
it 's hard for me to believe .
his temples have been drawn to their faces like these you see here , all the events or three-quarters of the incident .
so it 's definitely a sentimental painter because leonardo must have drawn his own face in different times .
then let 's try and find them .
i think if we go through all his work and look for his portrait , we 'll find his face that looks at us .
so i looked at all his paintings , more than 700 marks , and i looked into the men 's portrait .
it 's about 120 numbers you can see .
how can they be his own face ?
well , because they have to be like the last ones we saw or three or three .
then we can eliminate a half .
they must also be precise enough .
we can also eliminate those who are so vague or very light .
and we know from his temple that leonardo is handsome , even a beautiful man .
so we can eliminate ugly and ugly .
- and look what happened . - the only three candidates left with these symbols .
and they 're here .
yes , of course , the old man is here , also the famous man of vitruianus who was drawn with a pencil .
and in the end , the only portrait of the man that leonardo painted , the musician .
before we pay these three faces , i have to explain why i have the right to talk about them .
personally , it 's over 1100 miles for newspapers , over 300 , 30 years , i 'm sorry , i 've only made 30 years .
but there are 1100 numbers there and less articulate .
so i know a little bit about paintings and analysis .
well , now , let 's look at these three portrait .
and stay in your seats , because if we raise those faces , we will see that they all have extensive forehead , horizontal tiny , nose , and curves .
i could n't believe my eyes when i first met him .
there 's no reason why these portrait should look alike .
we 're all looking for the portrait of a picture of a portrait painted by a painter , and look , they 're very similar .
now , are they arranged ?
the young man must be made before the others .
and as you can see here , the years that they have created , they show the truth .
they 're built .
san leonardo , how many years have they been matched ?
he was 33 , 38 , 63 years old when they were made .
so we have three images , potentially from a person at the same age that leonardo had at that time .
but how do we know it was his image , and there 's no one else ?
well , we need a reference .
and the only image of leonardo that has been widely approved .
this is the statue that was built by vervain , david , when leonardo was made when he was a 15-year-old .
and if we compare the face of the idol with the face of the musician , you will see the same qualities .
the statue was reference , and they connect leonardo 's identity to the three faces .
ladies and gentlemen , this report has n't been published yet .
it deserved to be seen here alone in ted and for the first time .
the faces of faces finally revealed their face .
- he 's here . - leonardo da vinci .
the deco drive will return to hundreds of years ago in south africa for hundreds of years .
but it was proof that the communications and mass of new drugs are like a telephone wire .
the exodus of the village means that new industrial material is gradually relocating to normal grass that can barely be replaced .
so , in here , you can see this change from time to use of the use of contemporary material .
the history of these samples will be back in the ' 40s until the late ' 50s .
in the ' 90s , my passion for art and changing art has led me to a new form of art ... that i saw in the half-wind tent in the suburb of the desert .
and i 've taken this opportunity to work with this community at that time , and it 's been serious , and it 's a scale of design , and it 's a scale of design .
and the project arrived in a year from five winds to 50 knots .
soon because of their products , we have spread too far , and we 've asked a sim factory to come to our aid , not only to support the wire on the masores , but in the opinion of the product of our favorite color .
at the same time , i thought , well , in here , there 's a lot of possible product to produce the product , if it 's a race , a little more meaningful .
so , i did the whole thing around mass production , which clearly fits the market with larger and larger market , which could help and help the local market .
we were testing , as you can see , the shape of the shape , the scale was very important , and it became our favorite project , and it was 12 years ago , and it was amazing .
this is our group , the main crew of the wire .
they 're going to be on a weekly basis .
they all have bank accounts .
all of them have returned to the rural areas where originally from there have been .
it 's a weekly production of production .
this is where i showed you slides at the beginning .
it 's modern today , and he has done jobs for 300 pounds .
and the others say so .
thank you very much .
the applause of those of you who knows me , you know how much i am to beg the boundaries of space .
so when i got the chance to give the international gravity attraction to zero gravity , it was legendary for me .
and i want to tell you his story .
i met him the first time in the x-top x-ray , for genomics .
that 's the race we 're holding , the second enterprise , for the first team to count the 100 genome human genome in ten days .
we have something in the name of the 100 as a part of it .
craig venter runs that event .
and i met professor hawking , and he said it was his wish to travel into space .
and i said , i ca n't take you there , but i can take you to zero gravity .
and he said , " okay , sure . "
well , the only way to experience zero gravity is literally a persistent dive , flying in weightlessness .
you take a plane , jump from the top , you 're weightless for 25 seconds ,
back down again , you 'll have twice the weight .
do it again and again .
- you have eight , 10 minutes of weightlessness . - nasa has trained your astronauts for a long time .
we did the start .
it took us 11 years to be operational .
and we announced that we want to fly stephen hawking .
we had a government agency and a bartender who told us you were crazy , do n't do it , you 'll kill the guy .
-lrb- chuckles -rrb- and he wanted to go .
we worked hard to get all the butterflies .
and six months later , we were sitting in kennedy 's space center .
we had a press conference , we announced that we decided to go to zero gravity , give him 25 seconds of zero gravity .
and if it goes really well , maybe we 're three .
well , we asked him why he wanted to go up there and do it .
and what he said , it was very impressive for me .
he said , " life on earth 's peril is to destroy a catastrophe ... "
i think if mankind does n't have a future in space .
so i want to understand public interests . "
we took him out to kennedy space center , up inside the carrier of nasa , zero gravity .
- we had about 20 people who donated ... - we collected 15,000 units to help the children 's charities fly away .
there were some teddy bears here .
we got a full emergency room .
on the plane , we had four doctors in the emergency room and two nurses .
we 've got his p02 blood , heart rate , and his blood pressure .
we have prepared everything for an emergency .
we 've asked for the shuttle landing , where the shuttle gets up and sits down .
byron likeberg , and i carefully suspended him in zero gravity .
when she was there , we let her go to see how she really was .
and after that first cut , you know , the doctor said it was okay , he smiled , and we said go .
so we left the second part .
-lrb- laughter -rrb- and third .
we have landed an apple in honor of isaac newton because professor hawking has the same seat in cambridge that isaac newton had .
and we left the fourth , the fifth and the sixth .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- and seventh and eighth .
and this other man does n't look like a 65-year limit to a wheelchair .
he was very happy .
we live on a dime , and it will be during our lives , when we leave this planet .
please join us at this epic adventure .
thank you very much .
it 's funny when he met a government chief and asked him , " what 's your most precious source of nature ? " they do n't at first say that the source is the children .
and when you say he 's the source of the children , they will agree to you very quickly .
we 're traveling on our journey with the colombian defense secretary , the head of the army and the chief of police , 650 laptop from the helicopter , and they live in the same area for children that have been isolated over 40 years .
the importance of distribution of these laptops is to be linked to the children of the possibility that the farc forces were not connected , the farc forces were involved 40 years ago , and later they became a drug movement .
there is a billion children across the world that 50 % of them are deprived of power and power at home .
- and in some countries , afghanistan , for example , 75 % of the girl 's children do n't go to school .
i do n't mean they quit in third and fourth grade . they do n't go to school at all .
so , after three years i 've spoken in ted and showed a sample , it came from an idea to a real laptop .
we have half a million laptops today , we have half a million laptops today .
and about a quarter million in their way to them and children , and a quarter million in order at this time .
so , in public , a million laptops .
- it 's less than i anticipated .
we have 3,000 laptops in colombia .
this is the defence minister we work with , not the education minister , because it 's a strategic matter of defense , which means releasing the districts that were completely closed , that they lived in the same people 40 years of bombings and assassinations .
and suddenly , children have communication laptops .
and they communicate with each other .
it 's a real , historic change , not just to start it , but to show the whole world .
well , yeah , they 're building the road and they 're on the phone , yes , they 're gonna have tv .
but the children of 6 to 12 years on the internet , they work in spanish and local languages , so children will grow up to access information and windows all over the world .
before , they were deprived of everything .
interesting is that in other countries , the secretary of property is looking at this as an instrument of economic growth .
and those tools will witness the results of the next 20 years .
you know , it wo n't happen in a year , but it 's a real economic and cultural change , but it 's an economic and economic change that comes through children .
31 countries are now under cover , and it 's about oruguay , half the children already have laptops , and by mid-2009 , each child in oroguay will have a laptop .
now , what 's some of that fodder ?
a series of phoses that across every country is that teachers say that they never loved teaching so much , and understood the point of telling themselves .
probably the most important thing we can see is that children teach their parents .
the laptop is theirs , and they 're taking them home .
and that 's how one day , when i went to visit three schoolkids , one day they were on their way to bugata , one of them brought his mother along .
and it was the reason that his mother taught his mother , reading , writing and writing , teaching her mother to read and write .
her mother did n't go to elementary school .
it 's a very real picture , and it 's an excellent example of children who change .
and now , in the end , people ask , why now ?
the laptop is a luxury , it 's like we give them ipod .
it 's the reason for the laptop , the education , not the laptop .
it 's an educational project , not a laptop .
they need to learn to learn , and then , think well , they can , like , have a hundred books .
you have 100 laptops in the village , each with a different number of 100 copies , so suddenly , a village has 10,000 books .
you and i did n't have 10,000 copies when we went to elementary school .
some schools will be in the tree , or in a lot of cases , a teacher 's education is a fifth grade , so you need a common learning pattern , not just make a teacher , which , by the way , you have to do it .
we 'll do it once more . give me one . take one .
last year , we dropped one , we dropped one , and over 100,000 laptops , we were able to donate free donation .
and with free laptops , we can go to a lot of countries that ca n't afford to buy it .
and that 's what we did , we went to countries because t , psychoanalysis , afghanistan , ethiopia , and mongolia .
places where they 're open to expansion saturated , communication , and age , there 's no laptop for every child .
and then we can actually get big numbers out .
so , look at it like that , think of the children against neglect , vaccinations .
and look at the laptop as a vaccine .
you do n't make a number of children 's limited vaccine .
you all children will be vaccinated in a region .
well , i thought , " i 'm talking about death . "
it seems to be a lot of enthusiasm today .
actually , this is n't about death .
death is inevitable and terrible , but what i want to talk about is , i 'm just fascinated by people 's legacy when i die .
that 's what i want to talk about .
well , art buchwald left a sense of humor in a video that came too soon , saying , " hi , i 'm art rajold , and i just died . "
i met mike in gallagos during the journey from ted , leaving or left in virtual space , leaving cancer in his struggle , leaving the cancer in his own struggle .
my father left me a legacy from his writings and letter to me , my father gave me a legacy from letters and letter .
in the last two years of his life , when he was ill , he made a notebook of his own thoughts about me .
he wrote about my strengths and weaknesses , and his foundation to heal them , by making certain events , put in a mirror of my life .
after his death , i realized , no one writes to me anymore .
the art of handwriting is disappearing .
i 'm a fan of electronic letters and thought i was typing , but why are we leaving the old habits for something new ?
why ca n't we not write letters in our lives and have an e-mail ?
sometimes i want to trade all these years with my father and talk to my father , sometimes i want to trade all these years i 've been so busy dealing with my father , all these years , but it 's too late .
i 've changed all these years with him once , but it 's too late .
but when i read his letters , the paper he touched with his hands is in my hands , and i feel connected to him .
well , maybe we should all leave for our inheritance , not molly 's inheritance , well , maybe we should all leave for our inheritance , not molly 's .
something valuable , personal touch , signed a book , a ghost letter .
if that inspired a number of powerful audience to purchase a beautiful paper , if that inspired a number of powerful audience to buy a paper , it would be recycled , and a beautiful letter for those who love their loved ones , and write a beautiful letter to those who love them . go to class .
so what am i planning on leaving for my son ?
i have gathered the writing books , and i will follow the dns , those of you who are the writer of the author , follow them to those of you who are the author .
i planned to publish my manuscript .
because i witnessed my father 's body burn , in burning him , and wrote it .
i do n't have any idea how to do this , but i 'm committed to the fantasy of his mind and myself in the book , and i will leave the book for my son .
i 'm interested to finish this conversation with a few phrases of what my father wrote .
and those in linguistics , please pardon the language of the language , why i have n't looked at it for the last 10 years , and those who are linguists , please pardon the language of the last ten years .
for the first time , i took this to be here .
" the picture in frame , ashes in the bottle , is limited in the bottle , the image in the frame , the ash in the bottle , which makes me mature , which makes me mature . "
i heard you and my medal that you want me to be strong , but now , i am surrounded by emotional chemicals , but now , i am surrounded by emotional water and strangulation , to cleanse my soul , once again . my soul , once again , i will attempt a hard leg to continue to continue fighting , as you 've taught me .
your encouraging whisper in my disappointment is my keeper , and makes me feel healthy to live again , and i love it again , my keeper , and i will live on the beach again .
thank you .
we want to talk about the unfortunate ending of the truth today .

this is the way the ladies are n't blogging , that 's the way the ladies are blogging .
this is the natural state of human beings , my squat , and the air conditioning .
and i think it was chris ' inspirational image to distract me .
it 's a man 's writing situation , and the result is , " for comfort , men naturally put their feet farther apart than women , at work with a laptop . "
although this form is contesting less by its natural state , they want to keep the laptop in balance , and it leads to a significant increase in the body of the thighs .

is there anyone who thinks he needs an urgent need ?
no women , thank you .
in the aberration of the beginning of obama 's work , he asked all of us to work our best efforts to rid ourselves of the economic crisis .
but what does he ask ?
fortunately , he is not following his line of passage , which is just to say , " have fun and have fun . "
he also did n't say , " trust us , trust your country . "
invest , investment , investment . "
instead , he asked us to put aside our little behaviors .
and let 's make it up to you .
paki is the word " freeze . "
it seems a little inappropriate to bring in a delicate and delicate environment like this .
besides , there may be some of you asking . what does that mean ?
let me begin with an example .
it describes a hospital janitor moving on the screen .
all the cases are normal .
what you expect to do : " smoking in the building , vacuuming , vacuuming the cabinets . "
perhaps the number of them is marvelous , but what they are is not marvelous .
but the point that i want to get your attention is , although this list is very high , there is n't one single item in which there is no more human being .
not one .
as a hospital , the work of a janitor at the funeral home is done .
however , when a few psychiatrists interviewed the hospital janitors , they confronted mike , who told them how he stopped , because mr. jones had raised his bed and kept walking through the hall .
and charlene told them how to ignore the guardian of the director , and the rest of the rest of the patient 's resting place did n't clean the patients with a vacuum cleaner , because families were all over the place .
and this kevin luc , who cleans up two times a day in a man 's room , because his father 's father , who has been alive for six months , he has n't noticed , so he 's angry with him .
behavior like this from the janitors , the racists , the nurses , and if we 're lucky , sometimes it does n't make people feel better , but it 's actually gonna promote the hospitals to get good at it .
of course , not all the janitors are .
but those who are these species imagine that these types of human interaction , including kindness , care , are essential to the task .
however , in the description of their job , there 's not a single word in connection with other humans .
these janitors , moral intent , are doing the right thing for other people .
besides , they have moral skill to determine what the right deed is .
aristotle says , " action is a combination of intent and moral skill . "
the wise man knows when and how to make an exception for every law , as the janitors knew when to ignore their jobs .
the wise man knows how to improvise , like luke , with washing again .
things are often vague , often vague , and their concepts are constantly changing .
the wise man is such a jazz musician , who takes advantage of the notes , but in fact , only the only way they 're roaming around is to mix the position and the men .
the wise man knows how to use these moral skills in the right hands .
to serve others , not deceive them .
and in the end , perhaps beethoven said that the most important man of the wise is not born , but created .
wisdom depends on experience , not any experience .
you need time to meet the people you serve .
they 've been improvising and testing new ways , you need a warrant .
and you need a burning coach .
when i 've introduced the janitor i 've introduced , they ask how difficult they are to learn how difficult their job is , it 's a lot of experience .
they do n't mean to learn to learn to smoke and empty the garbage disposal .
but how to learn how to care for others is a lot of experience .
there will be many talent , talent , and subtlety .
and this is terrible .
fortunately , there 's no need to be susceptible to being wise .
on the other hand , without talent , it 's not enough .
and in the end , it 's the possibility that you and the others are in pain .
i hope we all know that .
there 's a concept that 's completely obvious , and now i 'm telling you a short story .
a story about lemonade .
a father with his seven-year-old son was watching at detroit 's baseball baseball game at the stadium .
the boy asked his father lemonade and father went to the stadium to buy a bottle .
the only brand is mike 's lemonade that had five percent alcohol .
father , who happens to be a well-adjusted individual , his soul was unaware of this kind of lemonade .
it bought and returned .
a child was drinking that suddenly one of the security guards found out and called 911 , and the police just called 911 and moved the baby to the hospital .
in the emergency room in the hospital , kaskov came up with no alcohol in the blood of a child .
and at the end of the day , they discharged the child .
but not too fast .
the surveillance agency and the wayne county welfare agency did n't allow it .
and the child was sent to an orphanage for three days .
in this case , can a child return to his home ?
the judge said yes , only if the father of the house left and lived in a motel .
fortunately , after two weeks , this family is reunited .
yet the welfare workers and the judge and the judge , they all believed that we were not satisfied , but we had to follow the rules . "
things like this , how are they going to happen ?
scott simon , who quoted this story in the npr , said the rules and regulations might be really stupid , but they 're going to stop thinking about you .
and if we 're being fair , the rules are often forced because the officials of the pioneering officials are as if the child was forced to return to the family of abuse .
fair enough .
when things do n't go according to millet , we have two tools to solve problems .
one of these tools is rules .
each of these rules is better , the tools of our problem will be more complete .
the second tools we get from it are motive .
even though the motivation is better , the tools of our problem will be more complete .
finally , what else is there ?
we can certainly see it in response to the economic crisis .
degenerative , premeditation , adjustment .
correction , correction , correction .
the truth is that no rules or motives are not enough to do anything .
how can you rule the law that makes the caretaker public and do what needs to be done ?
and do you know them as a reward for their sense of common sense ?
in appearance , it seems absurd .
and what happens is that we find an increasingly precursive form of rules , laws and motives may be progressively improved , but eventually they will create the cup that will cause your son .
more trust than the rules , it causes moral skill to deprive us of this opportunity to improvise and learn from improvisation .
and moral intent , with endless tuscles to the motives that would take the right to do the right thing .
and without this fantasy , with tuscl , with the rules and motivation , we 're fighting a war against wisdom .
let me play another example , first of the rules and war with moral skill .
the lemonade story is one of them .
the second one who has no doubt is more likely to be with you , the essence of modern education , in america , being prepared and unflexible .
i 'm going to hit the middle of the chicago childhood .
to read and enjoy the words of literature and words that begin with " b " and warn them about the dangers of hot water and warn them about hot water .
75 items in this script , there are a book of 25 pages .
all over chicago and in every class in the city of the city , every teacher spoke the same words and same day as the same day .
we know why it 's there .
we do n't trust teachers enough to let them pay their way .
you can because it 's a guaranteed policy against bad events .
and avoid bad events .
but what they guarantee is in the middle .
do n't get me wrong , we need the rules !
the descendants of jazz need a note , most of them need to exist on the screen .
god knows we need more rules for the bankers .
but a lot of rules , the great musicians , they make jazz style from improvisation .
and as a result , they lose talent and initiative , or worse , they put aside the descendants .
what about the motives ?
they look less subtle .
if there 's one reason for you to do something and i have the second reason to do that , it seems two reasons better than one reason , and most likely you will .
right ?
of course , it 's not always that way .
sometimes two reasons for a job , they 're in conflict with another , instead of admiring each other , and the probability of doing it is less likely .
i just give an example because time is running fast .
15 years ago in switzerland , he was trying to find a place to bury nuclear waste .
it 's supposed to be national france .
several psychologists went around and looked at the citizens of the city .
they asked them : " would you like to have a tank of nuclear waste in society ? "
surprisingly , 50 % citizens said , " yes . "
they knew it was dangerous .
they knew it was worth it .
but by the way , these garbage must go somewhere and they have duties as citizens .
psychologists have asked different questions from other people .
they said , " if we pay for six weeks per year , would you like to have a tank of nuclear waste in society ? "
two reasons , it 's my duty , and for that , i will receive a price .
instead of 50 % people say ari agreed only 25 % .
what happens is that this motive gives us a moment , so instead of asking , " what is my duty ? "
the only thing we ask is , " what good is it for me ? "
when the motives do n't work , when the ceo of the long health , the long health of their age , they ignore the short amount of time , the answer will always be one .
have a more subtle motivator .
the truth is , there is no motive for anything to be clever enough .
any kind of motivational system can be measured by bad intentions .
we need motive , people have to build their own lives .
but more than enough motives to discourage the motives of professional activity in two different positions .
it makes the people involved in their own conscience , and it also makes him lose his consciousness itself .
barack obama said , before the beginning , he said , " ca n't we ask if it 's a profit ? "
we can see the same in medicine .
" though it 's no big deal , we 'll be careful that we can see the same thing in the business world . "
" today , in order to remain in the market , i 'm afraid i must announce that we have to replace you with a tenth of the terrible things that are happening . "
then what can we do ?
a few sources of hope , we must try to restore our work .
a way to not do it , teach more moral units .
there will be no better way to present your knowledge of morality in a complex version of a man in a complex and a lesson in the form of a lesson .
what do we do in exchange ?
one : bring forth some of the moral ethics .
confirm when you go to law school which is a weak voice whispering about eunius finch .
no 10-year-old child is not going to law school and learning to do the law .
moral fiber inspired people .
but we will learn that with the skill that you can not confirm that you have a moral champion .
well , confirm .
proud of them .
bring them to an act of action .
and you want the people who teach you to approve them and bring them to the act .
this is one of the things we can do .
i do n't know how many of you remember this , another moral champion , aaron federstein , who was the ceo of the owner of the owner of the owner of the owner of the owner of the owner of the malden mills , and his work was on fire .
3,000 workers in this factory have n't been fired .
because in that case , there was a disaster for them and society .
" on paper , perhaps our factory is a little more valuable than wall street , but i can tell that there is something more valuable right now . "
just in the meantime , we 've heard speech of several moral heroes .
especially the two of them inspired me .
it was ray anderson who made a part of the former soviet union to a worthless home business .
because that was the right thing to do .
and the reward he 's earned is that he can make more revenue .
his factory workers are impressed by his efforts .
because they 'll be happy to do the right thing .
yesterday we heard willie smith 's speech about the woodwork in indonesia .
in many ways , this is a perfect example .
because nate did the right thing .
god knows it 's a very high skill set .
i wonder how much he and his partners needed to know that they could interpret it .
but more importantly , to work , and he has a point on this , it is that this is the idea of knowing people in society .
only if the men who work with you will not be defeated .
and there 's no formula to keep people behind because different people live in different communities .
here , in other places , there are many cases to celebrate .
and you do n't have to be a superhero .
there are ordinary heroes .
ordinary heroes are like the janitor who deserves to be appreciated .
in the lawyer 's position , all we have to do is to be normal , if we ca n't be an extraordinary hero .
in the head of an institution , we must reduce it to create an environment to strengthen moral function and moral intent .
even the wisest and benevolent people will give up if they have to swim against the water in the organizations that work .
if you run an organization , you have to ensure that none of them can describe a job as a job description , like a job description .
because the truth is that everything that includes the interaction with other humans is moral .
and every moral thing is to change .
and perhaps it means the most important in the teacher 's position , we have to cut to the championship , and ethics for the people we teach them .
there are several things that we must always remember in a teacher 's position .
one that we 're always teaching .
and someone else is always watching us .
camera camera is always clear .
bill gates talked about the importance of education , and especially , he was capable of the modeling model of kipp .
he also spoke of many wonderful cases that the kipp was doing to pick up the slums of the slums and help them on the way to the university .
i 'd like to focus on a particular case of kipp that bill gates did n't mention .
and it is that they have concluded that the most important and the only thing the children need to learn is character .
they need to learn to respect themselves .
they need to learn to respect each other .
they need to learn to respect teachers .
and most importantly , they need to learn to respect the learning .
and that 's our main objective .
if you do that , the rest is like a steep slope from the sea .
and teachers , the way you teach children , they force teachers and other workers to picture it at any moment .
obama has resort to a paki .
and i think he 's right .
and the virtue that we need higher than anything else is practical because it 's a virtue to another , kindness , kindness , courage , and allow it to come to the right shape .
and he also resort to hope .
he 's right again .
i think there 's a reason for hope .
i think people are going to be allowed to be virtuous .
in different shapes , that 's what they 've been able to do about it .
he wanted to do the right thing with the right reasons .
this is how you feel , in the circle of understanding all of us , only if we pay attention to it .
what we do , how we do it , and maybe more importantly , the construction of the foundation that we work to make sure that we are able to spread the wisdom of the wisdom instead of creating it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
you must come and stand here for a moment .
thank you so much , barry schwartz .
i wrote this poem after the tv interview , a very famous artist , i wrote a very famous artist , who said , " i worked too late on the internet , and i only wish that this was an organized . "
he said , " i worked too late with the internet , and i only wish this organization was more organized . "
okay .
if i had controlled the internet , you could have sold your broken heart on ebay .
take the money and go to the amazon , buy a phone book from a country you 've never been to , and just call a bunch of people until you find someone who really is good with a foreign language .
if i was the internet operator , you could have taken the map of the crazy newsletter .
stick to the left , shift to the right , shift to the silence of the cure , and return to kissing and love .
you can understand every emotional intersection .
some days , i 'm shallow like a frying pan , but i still kill myself in everyone .
if i was the internet owner , monster and friendsterssterstermaster , if i owned a web site , we were all a big website .
that way you could hear a good music while pretending you were looking for a job so you could hear a good music while pretending you were looking for a job and you were just chatting with your friends .
shame , if i ran webb 's night , you could email the dead .
they did n't answer your e-mail , but you get a pen response .
their name is in your mailbox anyway , it 's all you wanted .
and a message that says , " hey , it 's me . " i miss you .
listen , you see how amazing it is to die .
now turn around and raise the kids and make peace and wish candy .
if i had designed the internet , there could be a ring from a boy in the garden , with a ski bat instead of a sword , the door of the trash as a shield , which screams ,
" i am the emperor of portuguese , follow me now , okay ? "
" i am the emperor of portuguese , follow me now , okay ? "
" grandi . " com recipe , and it was a shower method .
one , two , three .
and in that case , the hotangögggggg is seen .
this is my grandfather .
which brings you to rough police on his fourth marriage .
he 's a join site for the site , making that boy , the portuguese emperor , the one i 'm supposed to be downloaded in the garden , the one i 'm gonna be , who 's gonna download the orange emperor in the garden . he goes beyond his own guess .
well , if i was the internet emperor , i guess i was still mortal , huh ?
but then , i probably had the lowest loan rate and the biggest genitals possible , but then i 'd probably have the lowest loan rate and the biggest genitals possible , but then i 'd probably have the biggest penis .
i did n't need him .
i 'm like some internet player , and i want to be promoted to god , and maybe just like this , pop .
maybe google bought this idea .
i can see your server and firestorm as long as the vast world of the wise , crowded and organized , as i think the miracle of the new world will be able to take this . am i going on a patrol ?
i think it 's like life .
- it 's not the question , if you can , but is it ?
we can interfere with the interface .
we can write your song " helloya " as a national anthem of virtual national anthem , and we can hear it every time we get lucky .
you do n't pray .
you do n't write a prayer .
do n't say " om . "
you 're a blessed , blessed , blessed e-mail to anyone you think will send to the dh-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da .
thank you , ted .
i told you three things .
i said the world was n't right .
and that 's why we still have our old thinking about developing countries , which , of course , is false thinking .
and the graphic charts can create a change of change .
everything is changing , and today , in the united nations website , it says that from the beginning of the moon , there will be complete access to the statistics center .
cheer up , folks , and if i can show you this picture on the screen ,
well , there 's been three incidents .
and we have a new version of an app that might be able to work online , which means you do n't have to download the software .
and let me repeat what you 've seen last year .
these bubbles are different countries .
here we have the fertility rate ... the birth of every baby on the count of women ... and there you have a lifetime of each year .
this is 1950 , and they 're industrial countries , and these are developing countries .
at that time , we had " we " and " them . "
it was a huge difference in the world .
but then it changed and there was a much better process .
and that 's what happened .
you can see that china is red and large .
it 's the blue circle of india .
i try to be more serious this year when i show you how the change has come .
and this is the country of africa as a real basis , is n't it ?
there 's still a lot of crowds and large hv disease , and the hds advanced level of advanced african countries .
that 's what we 've seen last year , and that 's what happens in the future .
and i will talk about it . is that possible ?
because you can see , i 've put amamari that does n't exist .
that 's why we 're here .
is it possible that this can happen ?
i 'll live my life insurance , you know ?
i expect to live a hundred years .
and this is where we 're meeting right now .
well , please look , we have the world economic situation here .
and i 'd like to show the applicants as well as the survival rate of children .
we change the axis :
here you have children 's death and death rate , and this is the survival rate of four children , and in this chart , there will be two children dead , and on this chart , 200 children will die .
and on this axis , i see a ceramic anomaly .
and that was 207 .
and if i return time in this chart , i add some historical numbers , see this , see this place , see this place , and a lot of statistics since the past 100 years .
some of the countries still have amar .
we 're looking into our archives , and when we get to 1820 , only austria and sweden have a possible statistic .
the laughter of amma was also down there , they had a thousand dollars a year for each man .
and they lost a fifth of children before tuzad 's birth .
well , that 's what happens in the world , if we check the world 's countries ,
how little few are richer , and ammar will add .
is n't it fun when they 're statistics ?
do you understand the importance of faith ?
and here , children are n't much longer alive .
for centuries , especially 1870 , for children in europe , it 's been a very bad time for the children , why most of these statistics are from europe .
and it was only in the late century that more than ninety percent of children were alive after the first year of birth .
this is india 's statistics , with the first statistics of india .
and this america is getting away , making more money .
and soon we 'll see china that 's far from this corner and reach this corner .
and with the microwave therapy system , it goes up , but it 's not much of a wealth .
there he goes and he dies , and ding jingleping brings the wealth of wealth to the pin ,
and this goes up this way .
and the circles still go up to the top , and that 's how the world looks like a hive .
cheer up , folks . let 's look at the american statistics .
in this software , we have a pattern , i can tell the world : " stay where you are . "
- i 'll take the american statistics , but we still want to see other countries in the background , and we 're moving back to the past .
and we can see that the united states of america leads to the right direction .
all of them are always on the money .
and in 1915 , the united states was a neighbor of india now , now , india is present .
and that means america was richer , but more than india lost the kenyan children , it 's consistent .
look here , compared to the philippines today .
the philippines almost got similar economic conditions in the first world war .
but we have to take america a little bit to have a state of health and health therapy , to the state of the philippines .
it 's about the state of the philippines in 1957 .
and it 's the show of the world that knows a lot of it , that asia and the latin countries are in the field of health and education and human resources , so they 're more economical .
in what happens now , there are inconsistencies in developing economies .
here now , there is social security and social development , stopping economic progress .
and in 1957 , the united states of america had the same economy as the country of chile now .
and how long do we have to put america on the back chart so that the condition of the health system and the healing system looks like chile today ?
i think we 'll go there , well , in 201 or 202 , america has the same health system as chile .
chile approaches !
perhaps in a few years of child survival , the child 's survival will be better than america .
it 's really a metamorphosis that we 're the effects of less than 30 or 40 years ago in the healing section .
there 's a system of education on the back of the treatment system .
and there are so many infrastructure agents involving human resources .
considering that , i want to show you the speed of change , the speed of change , that they move quickly .
back in 1920 , i 'm gonna take a look at japan .
and i want to look and watch the united states of america .
and i want to put a parade here , between this yellow ford here and toyota , the red toyota there , and the volovo will be brown .
all right , let 's go , let 's go .
as we can see , toyota has a very bad beginning , and the american ford will go off the road .
and the volovo goes well .
this is a war . toyuta is out of the way and toyota is taking swedish . can you see this ?
and now they 're passing the profits , and they 're going to light up , and now they 're past the profits .
and this is when i sold my lo and i bought toyota .
now we can see that the change of change in japan was very big .
they really brought themselves .
and this change has been made and permanent .
we need to pay attention to a few generations to find out .
if i may , i will show you the history of my family .
and it 's the same thing , the money 's under here , and the hygiene here , you see ?
this is my family .
this sweden , the year of 1830 , was born when my grandmother 's grandmother was born .
at that time , sweden was like sierra leone .
and this time my grandmother 's grandmother was born , 1863 .
and sweden was like the country of mozabuk .
and my grandmother was born in 1892 .
he took care of me like a child , so now i 'm not talking about statistics , now i 'm talking about my family tree .
only in that case , i accept a statistic , approved by my grandmother ,
and i think it 's the best way to confirm a history rate .
sweden was like a country of gaza .
and seeing a variety of variety is very attractive in the southern desert of africa .
i told you , parr , and now i repeat , my mother was born in egypt , and i ...
i 'm a mexican in the family ,
and my daughter is born in chile , and my daughter 's granddaughter was born in singapore , which is now the loneliest country in the world .
and singapore , two or three years ago , with a better rate of survival rate .
but as you know , the country is very small .
they 're so close to the hospital that we can never get them out of that forest .
with respect to singapore ,
singapore is one of the best , right now .
now this is a very good dustin .
but it 's not really a simple story . they 're all good stories .
because i need to show you some other facilities .
- we can use paint to show . - well , what am i choosing ?
carbon dioxide infection with ten units per person .
this is in 1962 , and america will send to joe every single person of 16-tons of contaminant material .
and china will only send six hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a half per person to joe , and this number is 300 kilos for india .
and what happens when we move forward ?
well , you can see that beautiful story , and we 'll see more healthy and more healthy ... all over the process , at the price of carbon dioxide .
and there 's no one who did n't do it .
and we do n't have access to all the data in the day because this information is really hot information .
and here we are in 2001 .
and in the presence of the world leaders , as you know , many say that the problem is the new economies , they produce a large amount of carbon dioxide .
the indian affairs minister said , " it was you who created the problem . "
- there are countries with high income countries . - they are the ones who have caused the problems of climate change .
but we forgive you because you did n't know .
but from now on , we can calculate the number of people .
from now on , we 'll be counting .
" and every country will be responsible for its population . "
it shows clearly that we have n't seen a good economy , or the development of the therapy system anywhere in the world without destroying the environment .
and that 's what needs to change .
i 've been criticized about why i show the world very pleasant images , but i do n't think it 's that way .
the world is not a regular place .
that 's what i can say to dollar of your dollar .
everyone lives on this street .
it will be the same number of house numbers that live in , that 's what they earn in a day .
this family gets a dollar a day .
we 're going to keep moving through this street , we 'll find a family that takes a day between two and three .
and then we drive here , and we find the first garden , the families of this place are 10 to 50 dollars .
how do they live ?
if we look at the bed , we 'll see that they sleep on the rug on the ground .
this is the line of poverty , 80 % of the family 's income , for the cost of a daily meal .
it 's between two or five dollars . you have a bed .
and this is a more beautiful living room , as you can see .
i gave a speech for ikea , and they wanted to see if that couch was here right away .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- and this is the couch , and how will he find it ?
funny thing is , when you look into the eyes of this picture , the family 's still sitting on the floor ,
although sofa is here , if you watch the kitchen , there will be no greater difference to women than ten dollars for women .
it 's on it , when you can be able to settle a good job in the family .
and if you 're still curious to see the real difference , you look at the bathroom .
it 's irreplaceable , it 's changing .
these images are all from africa , and you can see a lot of improvement .
we can get out of poverty .
my research is not about i.t. or anything like it .
i spent 20 years interviewing the african farmers with farmers on the brink of famine .
and that 's my conclusion about the farmers ' needs .
and what 's beautiful and you ca n't see the researchers in this picture ,
- when the study is for society ... - you need to live inside the community .
if you 're poor , it 's all live .
it 's about catering .
these two young farmers , girls , are girls because their parents are dead from hiv .
this is one of the smartest agrilogists in the country in mulholland , and they 're arguing about planting a model of a solar system that people found .
and with passion and affection , they listen to music , because they do n't lose their own lives .
it 's a manne .
saving poverty .
women only said one thing : " technology for us . "
we hate for this . we stand at the clock .
" get the mill so we can melt our flour , and we 'll pay for our own good . "
technology saves you from poverty , but still needs a market .
and this woman is very satisfied because they can bring her product to the market .
he appreciates a public investment in education to count and not be deceived .
she wanted her baby safe to go to market and she did n't have to stay in the house .
- and he wants infrastructure . - it 's nice . it 's a rock street .
they 're happy with credibility .
he bought the small debt .
and his information tells him which product and who goes to market .
you can do this .
my 20-year experience of africa was that there was nothing impossible .
africa has done well .
in 50 years of the medieval situation , the calpa has become a hundred years ago , working with countries that work .
i say black africa has improved more than any countries in the world over 50 years .
because we do n't understand how messed up their former situation was .
that 's a stupid idea of developing countries that we have mozabuk and argentina , 50 years ago , and says that mozabik has done worse .
we need to know more about the world .
i have a neighbor who knows 200 of the partners .
he knows everything .
he knows the name of the grape , and he knows it .
- i know two types of partners . - red and white .
but my neighbors know two kinds of countries ... the craftsmanship and developing .
and i know 200 types , i know tiny data .
but you can do it .
but i have to be serious right now , and how do i get serious ?
i 'll build a power blanket .
respect for abend shows ?
what is this , what is this , what am i ?
i 'm saying it 's developed a few dimensions .
everyone 's interested .
if you 're in financial terms , you like the reputation of micro .
if you 're trying in an illegal organization , you support the balance .
if you 're a teacher , you 'd like to be happy and disappear .
in the global level , we need to work together more .
we need everything .
all of this is important to development , especially when you 're recently out of poverty , and you have to turn towards welfare .
now , we need to think of what development is , and what 's the development ?
let me compare the most important things first .
for me , economic growth , as a public hygiene master , is more important to development than anything , because 80 % of the 100 % of survival rate will explain .
- having a government who has a government function ... - and it was to take california out of misery in 1850 .
it was the government who solved the end of the law .
lesson is good .
health is good .
the environment is important .
human rights are important , but the poor will be the only one .
what are we looking for ?
we do n't pay attention to the money .
money is not the target .
it 's the best thing , but it does n't matter to us .
the bureau is still not the target yet .
- and they 're not going to the ig . - it 's a device .
especially at my age .
that 's good . it takes two .
environmental environment is important .
if you do n't save it , it 's nothing for our grandson .
but where are the important ones ?
it must be human rights .
human rights are considered , but it 's not a strong development .
and culture , perhaps the culture is more important because it makes life rich .
it 's worth living .
so what 's impossible is possible .
even countries can do it .
and i showed you the possibility that what appears to be impossible is possible .
remember , do n't forget my original message , and that 's what looks like it 's impossible .
we can be a good world .
i showed you the images , i proved with your power blanket , and i think you 'll be convinced of the culture .
-lrb- chuckles -rrb- bring me my sword !
the sword comes from ancient india .
it 's been thousands of years since this culture has made people more imagining than their own meaning .
now what appears to be is impossible , i 'll prove it to you , i 'll get this piece of metal , the spear of the swedish army , from 1850 , in the last year we had war .
sharp metal that you can hear here .
and i 'm gonna hold this metal blade in my hand and shove it into my physical body , and you do what apparently is impossible .
please be completely silent for a moment .
this is the great impact of haderin .
it 's 27 miles ,
it 's the greatest science test ever to be taken .
over 10,000 physicist and the engineer from 85 countries have come together in decades to build this device .
what we 're doing is rushing the protons , we 're gonna accelerate the hydrogen core to 99.999 % of the speed of light .
at that speed , they run around a 20-mile perimeter 100 miles per second .
and we treat them with another preproton of protons that go against the opposite direction .
we 'll hit them in the great nest .
they 're actually digital cameras .
and that 's what i 'm working on , atlas .
you know , you 're gonna figure it out . you can fix it with the standard european size .
because there 's a little understanding of the work : 44 meters across diameter , 22 meters , weighing 700 tons .
we 're going to recreate the situation that in less than a matter of five seconds after the world began , there were about six hundred million seconds in that fire .
- and if you see those pieces of metal over there , they 're a massive magnet that bends the electrical particles of electric electric , and it takes to ride as fast as they can .
it 's a picture of a year ago .
those magnets are over there .
and again , the size of the european standard , so you can get an idea on the work scale .
and that 's where we 're gonna build small booms , one time around this year .
and by the way , i received email this morning that we finished the last piece of atlas today .
well , with his atoms today , i 'd like to say i had planned it , but i did n't do it .
yeah , it 's a great success !
well , maybe ask . why ?
" what are we going to create in a pool after the beginning of the world ? "
well , particles of particles , if they 're not ambitious , they 're nothing .
and the goal of particles of particles is to find out what it 's made of ?
and with the application of everything , i mean me and you , and the earth , the sun , a hundred billion stars in our galaxy , and hundreds of billions of galaxies that exist in our world .
really everything .
now , you might say , " okay , but why do n't we just watch them ? "
if you want to know what i 'm made of , why do n't we look at ourselves . "
well , we figured you 'd go back to the back of time , the world would be hotter and hotter , more and simpler , and simpler , and simpler .
now , there 's no reason why i know why , but it looks like it is .
in this case , in a very old age , we believe that everything was very simple and understanding .
all these complexity , this whole path to these amazing things ... the human brain ... everyone 's dreams of an old , cold world .
by returning to work , in the first pool of pool , we believe , or observing it is very simple .
it 's like ...
imagine a snow in your hand , look at it , and it 's incredibly complex , but when you warm it up , it 's gonna be in the mud , and then you see it 's just the h20 .
so that 's what we 're looking forward to in the past to find out what the universe is made of .
and these things are made of this day :
it 's just 12 female , linked with four nature forces .
the quarks , the pink stuff , the things that make your protons and neutrons create atoms in your body .
electron , these are on the rotation of the atom , being held in their orbit by electromagnetism , which carries with these things :
the quarks were clinging to me by things called galon .
and these here are weak nuclear forces , probably the least of the resemblance .
but it will not shine without that sun .
and when the sun glows , you have a large amount of these things called neutrino .
- in fact , if you look at your thumb , it 's about a centimeter of something about 60 million neutrino in a second of your body .
but you do n't feel them because they were named the weak force , too weak and weak , so they just pass through you .
and most of these particles have been discovered throughout the last century .
first , electron was discovered in 1892 , and the last one , which is notrino tave 's name in the year of 2,000 discovery , i just wanted to say , i know that america is a great country .
just on the road .
it 's only on the road to the world .
well , this one was found in 2000 , so it 's a relatively new image .
one of the cool things i actually think when i think about it , we 've never been able to find anything , when you 're considering how bad these are .
you know , these are the size of the distant world in the whole world .
so 100 billion galaxies , for the 1 7 billion light-billion light years of light , in fact , as far as monterey , in fact , is more like monterey than that .
and yet , we found a pretty nearly full hand .
one of our most famous followers at manchester rutherford was an atom explorer , he once said , " all science or physics collected . "
now , i do n't suppose it was an insult to other science , although it was new zealand , so it could be .
but he means what we did , actually collecting stamps .
- well , we found particles , but you do n't understand the basis of the pattern , which is why it 's built .
fortunately , we may have the greatest scientific achievement of the 21st century who formed the basis of this pattern .
you can if you 'd like to know the laws of the particle physics .
his name is " standard model . " simple math equation .
you can stick his head in front of a shirt , which is always a sign of greatness !
there it is .
i was a little unfair because i opened it up in the details of your homework .
this equation will enable you to calculate all the things that happen in the world except gravity .
if you want to know why the sky is blue , why atom 's nucleus are stuck with a computer , you can see why dna is like this .
technically , you have to be able to rely on him from the formula .
but there 's a problem .
can anyone see what 's wrong ?
a bottle of champagne for anyone to say .
i 'll make it easier , by bringing one of the lines .
a lot of these phrases represent one of the particles .
so the w shows up there , and how they cling to them .
this pregnancy is the weak , and so is the z .
but there 's another badge in this equation :
yes .
h stands short for higgs particles .
higgs particles have n't been found yet .
- but they need to . - you need to answer the math .
so all this hard and hard calculations we can do with this perfect equation , it 's not a bit of an option .
- it 's a prediction . - a new corn prediction .
what 's he doing ?
well , we 've been taking a long time to make a good deal .
and in 1980 , when we wanted money to build the lhc government , margaret thatcher said , " if you can explain what you 're really doing , you 're gonna take the money . "
i want to know what the higgs particle is doing . "
and we made that comparison that seemed to be the point .
well , what higgins does is give crime to the fundamental particles .
- and the idea is that the whole world ... and the whole world is n't just space , i mean , or inside of you , the whole world is full of things that are called higgs square .
or higgs particle .
compared to the fact that there are people inside a room and they 're higgs particles .
now , when a particle moves into the world , it can affect the particles of the higgs particle .
now imagine someone who 's not very popular in the middle of the room .
everyone ignored it , and it could get through the room so fast , it could normally pass through the speed of light , because it 's not a crime .
and now imagine a very important and popular person entering the room .
he 's surrounded by people , and it 's gonna be in the dam room .
it 's just like getting heavy .
and that 's exactly how it works .
you can imagine that electrons and quarks and quarks are heavy in your bodies and around the world around us , in a way , because they 're surrounded by higgs particles .
they 're consistent with the heggs field .
if this is the right image , then we need to find these higgs particles at lhc .
- if it 's not true , because the mechanism has a twisted twist , though it was the simplest thing we could think of , in which case , whatever the higgs particle does , we know that we need to be revealed in lhc .
so it was one of the first reasons to build this huge car .
i 'm glad you recognized margaret thatcher .
actually , i thought it was culture , but , well , whatever .
so this is an article .
that 's basically guaranteed in lhc .
there are so many other things , you 've heard a lot of great physics problems .
one of the things you 've heard is dark matter , dark energy .
- the other is nature 's forces , the forces of nature , which are beautiful , and in fact , it seems that whatever you 're going back to , their power changes .
well , their power really changes .
for example , electromagnetism , the force that keeps us together grows stronger .
strong , strong nuclear force , which sticks the core into me , and what you can see in this standard is that you can calculate how these things change .
it 's like all three of them are a superpowered cloud at the beginning of time .
but they lost him .
now there 's a theory called " supersymmetry , " which doubles the number of particles in the standard model that does n't seem to be simple at first glance .
but in fact , with this theory , the nature of the nature of nature appears to be united at the mahg , a single prophecy was not meant for this , but it seems that it does .
besides , those supersymmetry particles are very likely to be a dark female candidates .
so it 's a very potential theory that truly prevails of physics .
and if i 'm willing to bet on it , i 'm going to put my money in a very non-scientific shape on these things , which is probably gonna happen at lhc .
a lot of other things can be discovered at lhc .
but on the last minute , i just want to offer you a different point of view ... about what i think of the particles of physics for me .
and it is that these things have presented us a beautiful castle , almost if you 'd like to create some kind of creation story about the universe , modern science in the last few decades .
and i 'd like to say that this is a matter of speech wade davis , as at least by the local local folklore , the east and north of the ice .
this is the story of creation that i think is as wonderful as they are .
the story goes like this : we know that the world started 13 billion years ago , in a very hot and intensive state , much smaller than an atom .
- then he started to fall into a million billion billion billion billion per second , i think i was right after the mahg .
gravity has been separated from other forces .
then the world has gone under a rug where inflation will be called .
in about a pool of pool and a second , the higgs field came in , and then the quarks and galaxies and electrons were weighing us .
the expansion of the universe continues .
after a few minutes , there were hydrogen and hemes in the world , that 's all .
the world was nearly 75 % hydrogen , and 25 % is still today .
the expansion of the universe continued until about 300 million years .
then the light started traveling into the world .
it was big enough for the passing of the passing light , and that 's what we witnessed on the earth 's surface , and george smot described it in god 's face .
about 400 million years later , the stars were formed , and the hydrogen , and it was hitching , started cooking and turning into heavier elements .
so the elements of life , carbon and iron , and iron , all the elements that we need to create ... were cooked in the elite of the stars , and they spread the elements into the universe .
then they collapsed again and created the second generation of planets and planets .
and in some of those planets , the oxygen that was first created in the stars combined with hydrogen combined and creating water on the surface of the surface .
at least one , and maybe only one of those planets had a primitive escape , who walked on their legs over a million years ago , and left their footprints in tanzania , about three and a half million years ago .
and created this civilization , this beautiful image created darkness , and you can see this civilization from space .
as one of my greatest personal heroes carl sagan said , " these are the things that they can do , and in fact , not only these , but i look around .
absolutely fantastic .
and physics rules , right ?
physics are the right rules of physics .
if the weak were a bit different , carbon and oxygen would n't be stable within the heart of the stars , and none of this existed in the world .
and i think it 's a wonderful , wonderful story .
i could n't tell this story 50 years ago , because we did n't know that .
it really makes me feel like this civilization ... which , as i said , and if you believe the science of the creation of the creation of the universe , it 's completely applied to the laws of physics , and then i think it makes me feel so valuable .
so this is lhc .
once it 's clear in the summer , it will write a new chapter in this book .
and i am certainly very eager to be clear .
thank you .
how many of you have seen the birds of alfred hitchcock ?
did anyone from you look scared to see him ?
maybe you should leave now .
well , it 's a vending machine for crows .
and in the past few days , many of you have asked me , " how did you get here ? " how did you start this ?
it started like the best ideas , or at least like many of those ideas you ca n't get rid of , at a party .
nearly 10 years ago , i was at the feast with a friend of mine , and we were sitting together , and he was complaining about the crows , that they were in his yard , and they ruined everything .
and he told me we had to try to eradicate them .
we have to eliminate them because they 're always messing around .
i said it was stupid , you know , maybe we should teach them something useful .
and he said it was possible .
i think you understand better than anyone , how painful it is to tell you that something is impossible .
that 's why i gave 10 years to read about the crows .
and after 10 years of my wife , my wife finally said , " look , you know you have to do this , now you 've been talking about building this vending machine . "
so i made it .
but the interesting part for me , is that i began to realize how much we had to go extinct in the development of human beings , and it seemed that no one would be paying attention to other kinds of creatures that remained alive .
i 'm particularly talking about the city animals who are used to human life , species because rats , cockroaches , and crows .
and the fact that my investigation began , i realized more compatible .
that with the skills to live with us .
and in front of us , we 've always tried to destroy them .
and in the meantime , we had to grow up to be an intruder .
we used to give them a different excuse .
for example , the rats are very good at production .
and the roaches , since everyone who knows they 're trying to destroy them , they 're used to use a very resistant toxin .
so i 'm thinking , to make something a mutual advantage .
well , then something new must have made both of it and a new way to this new relationship .
that 's how i built a vending machine .
but the story of this device is a little more interesting than that if you know more about the crows .
it looks like crows have n't spent their own lives alone with humans , they 've improved .
they 're found all over the earth except the north pole and north america .
and in the majority of these places , it 's rarely more than five kilometers away from humans to reproduce .
so maybe we 're not paying attention to them , but they 're always on our side .
and according to human population , more than half of them live in cities .
and a tenth of human growth also comes in the cities .
we 're watching growing up in crows .
the birds of the birds show that even the possibility of an increase in their numbers .
so this is n't so weird .
but the discovery of it was interesting that these birds were strangely related to the symposium .
i 'll give you an example of this .
this is betty , a raven of calden .
these crows use a piece of wood to access insects and whatnot .
here he tried to get a piece of meat from inside a pipe .
but researchers had a mistake ,
they made the mistake of creating a single piece of wire .
and he was never faced with that .
as you can see , it 's not very successful .
so he 'll accept this .
now , this is undignified , he has never been able to do it .
no one taught him to remove the wire , or show how it could be done .
but he did it alone .
so remember , he 's never seen anything like this .
okay .
yes .
well , that 's where the researchers wonder .
we 've just had more and more of the crows .
their brain fits , and it fits the image of chimpanzees .
there 's a different story about their understanding .
for example , in sweden , crows wait for the hook fish to freeze in a hole in the ice .
and when the fish gets away , the crows come down , and they eat the hook , fish or bait .
it 's very upsetting for fishermen .
in other ways , a few years ago , at washington university , in the university of university , they were taken several crows to test .
a group of students trapped a few crows , and brought them to weigh and measure and say , and then let them go .
it 's funny that the rest of the week , every time these students walked in campus , these crows used to cave to them , and they made the lives of students difficult .
this story was less amusing when it continued another week .
and the next month , and after the summer ,
as long as they graduated and left college , and i believe they were happy to leave , they realized that the crows still remembered them .
so the outcome is not to displease the crows .
from anro , university of washington , university of washington , is using tall wig and big painters .
it 's rather interesting .
well , then we know that these crows are very smart , but most i did , i realized that they were more compatible .
the crows have found a lot of skills for life in the city districts .
in this town , in japan , they found a way to eat food that ca n't usually run them .
the problem now is to collect the pieces without breaking up .
they wait for the lights to keep traffic .
then , in the full safety of the broken nut .
yes , yes , very interesting .
the main thing is that crows use cars to break hazelnut .
but this is something that 's happened to the crows .
he came in at sandstorm for about 10 years ago at sandstorm .
and since then , every crow in the neighborhood has learned this behavior .
right now , at a five-mile radius , he 's waiting four miles to pick up his lunch .
they learn each other , and the investigation shows it .
parents teach their children .
they have learned from their people and their enemies .
if we had an extra time , we would tell you about the affair between the crows , which points to the point .
the point is , they 've developed cultural adaptations .
and as i heard yesterday , this is the box of secrets that amazes humans , and we are discovering them .
they adapt so quickly to the closets and their position that were very useful in the city .
we know there are so many crows .
we found out they were very smart , and they could teach each other .
when all this came out to me , it seemed to me that the most obvious job was to make me a vending machine .
so i touched it .
it 's a vending machine for crows .
it uses skinner 's way to form behavior in four stages .
very simple .
we put this device on a farm , or where there are so many crows , then we put coins and peanuts around the machine .
the crows eat the peanuts and get used to the machine .
and eventually , they 'll finish all the almonds .
then he got the almonds on the floor floor , and they ate them .
when they leave , this machine gives more and more coin , and if you 're a crow , it 's beautiful for you .
then you 'll be back as soon as you want , and you 'll be ready for the second .
when they get used to it ,
they 're used to the sound of the machine , and they 'll come back and find the almonds from the coins .
when they 're satisfied with this , we will make an obstacle to them .
we 've reached stage three , which we provide only coin .
now , like most of us , we get used to the good things , this is going to hurt us .
so , like their nature , in search of something , they start to radiate objects with their lackeys .
in effect , one of the coins would fall into the car , and it would lead to a nut .
and this will continue for a while .
the crows learn that by coming to this device , patience for coin , and they will reach the machine .
when they 're so used to this story , we 'll get to the final level , that when it comes , nothing happens .
it 's here that you can see the difference between crows and other animals .
squirrels , for instance , come looking for almonds , leaving the machine .
they come back , they look for almonds , and they go .
they do this six times , and they get tired , they go and play in traffic .
crows , but they come , and they try to understand it .
they know that this machine has deceived their serpents in three stages of behavior .
they know this is n't over .
so they 'll peck it and say it .
" hey , there 's a lot of coins from the first step around the earth , and he 's gonna cut it , and it 's gonna blow it , and it 's gonna blow it . "
and this goes on .
this crow enjoyed short-term privilege to have his friends learned from him , and continued the story .
the fantastic result is not for me that crows can pick up peanuts .
if you know , every year , two hundred million dollars are lost in coin , of course i ca n't expect the crows to come back .
instead , i think we can look at this wider matter .
i think the crows can train for other things .
for example , why do n't we teach them to gather the garbage of the stadium ?
or search for expensive pieces ?
and do the rescue business ?
the main thing , and the main thing for me is that we can find a way to be useful for both of these creatures .
we can find ways to communicate with these creatures , without testing them , but to find them useful .
thank you very much .
not the day i had a fire .
the archives include 175 movies , 16 million movies , all my books , my father 's books .
- i was gathering everyone . - i was a great tornado , extremely ...
it 's gone .
i just looked at him and i did n't know what to do .
- i mean , is that ... - have i been my stuff ?
- i live in the present . - i love alan .
i cherish the future .
and i was taught something strange in childhood , as if you had to make something good from something bad .
you need to make something good from something bad .
that was a bad thing , man , i had a cough .
that 's my camera lens .
the king , mori , the film winner at 1970 .
this is my article .
- it all happened 20 minutes . - 20 minutes .
i got a little bit of a mess , something happened to me .
" you have to make something good from something bad , i started saying this to my friends , my neighbors , my sister . "
by the way , it 's spunke . i did it last year .
sputnik was downtown , did n't look , never touched .
these are some other things i used in spitnik film , which will be in new york city in the next two weeks , downtown .
i called my sister , called the neighbors , told you to look .
that 's my desk .
i 've spent 40 years building it .
you know , everything .
she 's my daughter , jjera .
he 's here , he 's a nurse in san francisco .
look , i said , " change of roses . "
" i want the pieces and the pieces . "
i thought of this idea : life and debris that i started working on was my next project .
he fixed the pictures because i was the great one i believed had a lot to say .
and they 're some of the photographs that were good about the burnt photographs .
i did n't know , i looked at it .
- it was the only copy i had . - pieces of it .
the idea of a woman .
so i started saying , " hey , man , you 're a lot of things . "
you could cry for this . i did n't .
i said , " i 'll make something , maybe next year , and i appreciate it , in front of all these people , and tell ted , " i 'm proud of myself , and i 'll make it a good thing . "
this is arthur lipzig 's original photo that i love .
i was a big fan of music , the records did n't last , man , seriously , he was rolling .
i mean , this was 16 millimeter .
the negatives are gone .
this is my father 's letter to me who told me to marry a girl i married at 20 .
this is me and my daughter .
he was still there this morning .
this is my house .
my family lives at the hilton hotel in scotty valley .
this is my wife , heidi , who did n't make it as well as i do .
my kids , dave and henry .
my son , dave , it 's been two nights in the hotel .
so my message to you friends , in my three minutes , is that i appreciate the opportunity to walk through this with you .
i come to live and live .
it saw me out of my window , santa cruz at the bonny devon , 35 miles away from here .
thank you , everyone .
when i was head of the american psychology council , they tried to make me a media media , and an encounter that i had to talk about today , all i had to do was summarize it , which is an overcrowding .
editor of the diskol magazine told us 10 of them , i 'll say the same crowd for you .
well , they came from the cnn and said , " professor selina , how do you see the psychology situation ? "
we want to interview you about this , and i said , " great . "
and he said , " because it 's cnn , you only have a short answer . "
and i said , " all right , how many words can i use ? "
he said , " well , one . "
the shooting started and asked , " professor selina , what 's the status of the state psychology ? "
" good . "
cut cut . that 's not gonna happen .
we 'd better give you a longer chance . "
" well , how many words can i use this time ? " i think so , two .
dr. selina , what 's the status of the state psychology ?
" not good . "
look , dr. selina , it 's obvious that you 're not comfortable with these interviews and you 're not familiar .
we 'd better give you a better chance .
you can use three words this time .
professor selina , what 's the status of the state psychology ?
" well , that 's not enough . " and that 's what i want to talk about .
i 'd like to say why the psychology was good , why it was n't good , and how in the next ten years , maybe it could be good enough .
and i want to discuss the same thing in short , entertainment , and design , because i believe it 's very similar to each other .
then why was psychology good ?
well , for over 60 years , the psychology of psychology was involved in disease .
10 years ago , when i was on the plane , i introduced myself to my arms , and i told them my job , they kept away from me .
because , as it was , they said psychology was the point of the human weakness .
and right now , when i tell people what i do , they approach me .
and what was good about psychology , 30 billion dollars of dna of the imf , was about what you 're doing with the sick patterns , about what you know , 60 years ago , none of this is treatable .
and right now , 14 of these are treatable , two of them are practically terminal .
and what happened was a growing knowledge , the science of mental illness .
it was that we discovered that we could take matters from depression , depression , alcohol , and to measure them carefully .
that we could invent a classification for mental illness .
that we were able to figure out for mental illness .
we were able to monitor special people for a period of time , for example , people genetically schizophrenic , and we asked what a mother 's share of the universe was capable of using experiments on psychotic diseases .
and most of all , we 've been able to invent drug therapy for the last 50 years , to invent drug therapy ,
and then they were carefully carefully controlled by the allotment of gastros and controlled methods , and we kept the inefficient ways of running things around , and we kept them off the charts .
and it is the result that psychiatry and psychiatry in the last 60 years can actually claim the ability to sell people .
and i think it 's really amazing .
and but the negative numbers were the three things .
- the first was moral , psychologists and psychiatrists became the victims and pathologists , and our point of view was very pessimistic .
and we forget that people can choose and decide .
we forgot the responsibility .
the second strike was that we forgot you people .
we 've forgotten to give a normal life .
we forgot this mission that was targeting people without difficulty and procuring more , productive , prone to making ugly .
no one 's working on it .
and the third issue of the disease is that in our camel to help with troubled people , and in our camels , it never occurred to us that we raised the interference to make people happier .
so that was n't good .
and that 's why you 're special because nincy eckbert , dan gilbert , and myself , we 've been directed to work in positive psychology , which has three targets .
the first is that psychology cares just as much as you care about the skills and weaknesses of mankind .
in the same amount of damage , he must be able to amplify the skills .
he must be interested in the best things in life ,
and that 's the same time that he cares about the evolution of ordinary people , and he needs to care about the rise of genius and talent .
so in the past 10 years , and with hope of our future , we have witnessed the beginning of positive psychology :
turns out we can even synthesize happiness .
and each of you can free that website for free and take a lot of happy tests .
by these tests , you can compare positive emotions , meaning , and flow with thousands of other individuals .
we 've developed a classified system called the csv , a classified system called csv , which represents the capacity and virtue of gender , and how it can prevent them , and how it can prevent them .
we 've discovered that we can find out for positive quality , relationships between a half-left and right-brain activity , the reason for happiness and bliss .
i 've spent my entire life working on a very dark person , and i have asked , how are the people different from the dark side with the rest of you ?
and about six years ago , we started looking for a very happy person ,
how are they different from the rest of us ?
and it turns out there 's a way .
they 're not much better , they do n't have any better money , they do n't have much , they do n't have any better shape , and more positive things happened to them .
the only way they 're different is that they 're very sociable .
they do n't sit in a seminar on saturday morning .
-lrb- laughing -rrb- they do n't spend their time alone .
each of them is in a romantic relationship , and each of them has a rich set of friends and friends .
but be careful , it 's all connected , not sebastian , and i 'm talking about joy on the hollywood level :
and soon i will suggest that this kind of happiness is not enough .
we 're going to be able to get into the middle ages , from buddha , from buddha to the turks .
there are about 20 years of intervention being offered to make people happy and satisfaction .
and we found out that we can take a lot of them , and we can actually do some random gags on their jobs and influence .
to see which one of them can truly make a lasting happiness for the individual ?
in a few minutes , i 'll tell you some of these results .
but ultimately , the mission i want to have psychology , in addition to the treatment of mental disorders , and the reduction of the bad people , is it that the psychology can make people happier ?
- and to ask this question ... - happiness is not a word that i use so much .
- and i believe there are three different types of different species ... and i separate them , because according to different interference , it 's possible to have one of them instead of different .
a happy life , a pleasant life .
it 's a life you have to have positive emotions , plus skills to amplify it .
the second , the life of your career , the children of children , your love , your precious times , your time .
that 's what aristotle talked about .
and third , life is meaningful .
well , i want to talk a little about each of these lives and the knowledge we have .
the first life is a pleasant life , and it 's as simple as it may be , having a positive amount of positive emotions as far as possible , and learning the skills that they can sustain through time and space .
the liken life has three obstacles , and that 's why , positive psychology is not merely happiness , and it does n't appeal here .
the first obstacle is because 50 % of your experiences are positive for positive emotions , they ca n't be modified .
so , the different ways that machiro and i know about the positive feelings of your life in your life are 15 % until 20 % .
it 's the second thing that 's a positive affection , actually .
it 's like vanilla ice cream , first taste of 100 % , when you reach the sixth , it 's gone .
and like i said , it 's not exactly flexible .
and now , this brings us to the second life .
and i have to tell you about my friend , len , to see why the positive psychoanalyst is more positive and the joy of the joy .
in two great scenes of life , len was perfect at 30 , the first scene of his life was a job .
in 20 , he was an opera merchant .
at 25 , he was a millionaire , and he was the head of an opera company .
the second scene of his life was in fun and fun .
but at the third scene , in love , len is a lost loser .
and that 's why len is cold-blooded .
-lrb- chuckles -rrb-
the american ladies called it , you do n't have a positive feeling , get lost .
and because len was rich enough , he managed to provide a psychoanalyst for himself , who tried to find lenny 's sexual injury for five years , who had hidden his positive emotions in his existence .
but it turns out there was no sexual damage .
len grew up in long island and playing american football and watching it play cards , len on the bottom of five % of what we call positive .
the question is , is len unwell , and i want to say no .
despite what psychology tells us about people who are positive at 50 % of this , i believe len is one of the happiest people i know .
he 's not a hell of a trust fund because len , like many of you , is completely capable of creating a wonderful moment .
from 9:30 a.m. , it 's going to stop in the amenagine hall until the time to ring for the time hall .
ever since the first card starts in the card game , the time will be stopped until the games are over , time to stop .
and it 's actually the same thing that mike checkcheck is talking about , about the most amazing moment , and that is a very important pleasure .
you are aware of their dreams , thoughts and emotions .
but what mike said to you yesterday was not a sensation .
in that , you come with music , time stops .
you have severe focus and strong .
and indeed , that 's what our good , healthy life we have in mind .
and we believe that the order of this life is true to potential potential .
and again , there is a very prestigious test that will recognize five of your greatest skills .
that you can make your life a new form so that you can use those skills to end .
new learning and new form to your work , to your love , to your friends , to your friends , and motherhood .
for example , one of the ones i worked with was a bag of genitalia .
he hated his job .
he was working during his college education .
his greatest ability was his insight and intelligence , so he gave this bag a new form , so he gave the customers a new form to turn the customers into their daily social experience .
well , obviously failed .
but what he did was a new form to be able to use his potential capabilities as possible .
it did n't have anything to do with smiling .
it did n't have anything to do with debbie reynolds .
it did n't have anything to do with the val .
which is the second time , the first way , positive emotions .
the second time , there is a happy moment of joy .
and the third is the meaning of life .
that is officially the most important happiness .
and the meaning of this look is equal to happiness , and it involves your potential capabilities , and using them to somehow belong to what you belong to .
did i mention that right now , for each of these three types of lives , the people hardly want to question whether there 's anything that can change the change of life ?
and i will tell you a number of samples .
inspection it is very precise .
same way we test the drugs to see if they really work .
so we try different interference under different methods , like a random allotment , and long-term studies .
one of the effective intervention is that when we teach people the pleasure and method of receiving the pleasure , one of your arrogance is to take care of insight and taste , and design a beautiful , beautiful day .
next saturday , for you , a beautiful , beautiful day , and using the sight of the intuition , try to increase the joy .
thus we can show that the pleasures of the pleasures have increased .
i ask all of you to do this to me , please .
close your eyes .
i want you to remember the person who has done something very important in your life , something that has changed your life to recovery , and the one you 've never thanked him for .
this person has to be alive .
you can open your eyes .
i hope you all have one such person .
the arrogance of a meeting of gratitude and gratitude is that a letter of consent has three words for that person , and with that person on the phone , and ask for the call and ask for a visit .
and when we try these people a week , a month , three months later , each two happier and less depressed .
another sample is a promise that we 're asking couples to recognize the most amazing ability to test the test , and to design a visitor that is both able to use their ability to exploit , and we have concluded that this is a matter of communication .
and joy against mankind .
liken is a comfort in such a group , and that 's why you 've given a lot of your life to a humanitarian .
well , my student college students and my colleagues have n't discovered it yet , we 've told the people that an act of friendship is merely a kind of friendship , and then compare them to each other , and then compare them to each other .
and we discovered that when you do a entertainment act , it 's temporary and temporary .
but when you do a humanitarian act to help someone else , the joy remains stable .
so these are examples of positive interference .
so the first and last thing i want to say is that we 're interested in knowing how happy people are to their lives .
and that 's really all you are , and the target is our own .
and we will question the question as a performance for these three types of lives , how much satisfaction do you receive from your life ?
- so we ask ... - and we have done this by 15 times the same than thousands of people , how much of the pleasure , the ability to pursue positive emotions , to be committed , and meaning , in your consent , in your consent ?
and our results were amazing , but unlike what we imagined .
the pleasure of the pleasure does n't nearly have a share of the satisfaction of life .
making sense of everyone is stronger .
it 's very strong to get a commitment .
when the pleasure is committed and the meaning of both hands , then the pleasure will be like whipped cream and cherry .
in a phrase , in full life , a large collection of members is more complete than members , if you have all three lives .
and if you do n't have any of these three lives , in empty and empty life , the big set is less than a crowd .
and our current question is , do they have body health , unpleasant , lifespan , and things that follow the same relationships ?
do you mean in a group participation , positive emotional function , commitment , meaning ?
are you healthy , positive emotions , pleasure and meaning in life ?
and there are reasons we think the answer to both of them is probably positive .
well , chris said the last speaker had a chance to use what he heard here , and it was very interesting to me , i 've never been in this business meeting .
i 've never seen the speaker of their conversation so much , which is very impressive .
but i 've discovered that psychological issues are some kind of technology problem , entertainment , and design .
we all know that technology , entertainment , and design can be used .
we also know that technology , entertainment , and design can be used as a waste of misery .
and , by the way , the difference between the two of us is a very important thing to create and create happiness .
30 years ago , when i was a therapist , i thought that if i was able to not be depressed , i would n't be angry about it , it meant that i made them happy .
i discovered that the best thing to do is that it came to nothing .
but they were the tattoos .
and it turns out that the happiness of happiness , a lovely life , is committed , and meaning , with the technical skills .
so i believe that it was the drugs with technology , entertainment , and design .
i mean , it 's quite possible that our world 's three stimulus , happiness and positive emotions , is often used .
and once upon a time , as i have planned , you also refuse , not just positive emotions that are not simply enough .
as he told us , the design , and i believe that entertainment and technology can also be used to increase a meaningful bond in life .
so in the meantime , it 's an overcrowder for optimism , in addition to the space elevator , which , by using technology , entertainment and design , we can actually increase the extent of the happiness and happiness of mankind on this planet .
and if technology can form a pleasant , meaningful life in one or two centuries , it will be good enough .
if it can be good enough , it would be good enough to see the positive sense of positive emotions , meaning , and happiness .
and if you can design positive emotions , happiness , wonderful moments , and the most meaningful times we are doing , it will be good enough .
basically , there 's an important population event happening .
so today the world is planning a plan .
before , paris and london and new york were the greatest cities .
but we now have reached the end of the western development .
these numbers are powerful .
well , the villages of the universe are empty .
the question is , why ?
- and the unfortunate truth is , in the era of the german renaissance they said the air of the city would release you , which is why people were often driven to places like shanghai .
these are not necessarily poor .
but there are people who run all speed from poverty and poverty .
those are distinguished makers and so many designers .
they have household work and shake the life of the city .
a sixth of gdp comes from mumbai from mumbai .
they thrive in advance , and in petty cases , the government helps them .
training is the most important event that can happen in cities .
what 's going on in mumbai streets ?
al gower knows , basically everything .
there are no unemployment .
one sixth of human forces is present , and that number will be more soon .
this is the first point , cities have neutralized a population bomb .
and this is the second important thing .
this is news from central city .
the stars of billions have lived on earth .
and now we come straight to them .
thank you .
these stones are about three billion years to hit our earth , and most responsible for what happened on our planet .
this is a sample of a true meteor , and you can see the melting of this iron by the speed and heat of the earth , and see how much melted and lasting out of it .
from a space meteor , we 're here with the wizard of the soviet union .
this is one of the seven first satellites left to the soviets not to launch .
it 's not a copy .
the era of space was beginning 50 years ago on october , and the satellite satellite looked exactly like this .
and speaking of the evening , it can not be enjoyed without seeing the flag that was carried to the moon by apollo 11 .
each astronauts carried 10 silk flags with their own personal equipment .
they turned our feathers and took the frame .
and that actually went back to the moon and came back .
well , they were all interesting .
of course , the era of the book is important .
and speaking of the start of the book can not be interesting without a copy of a gutenberg bible .
you can see how much of a man 's bible was carrying in 1555 .
but , there 's no reason to be paying attention to the gutenberg bible or the beginning of this technology .
you know , the book did n't go by reading .
in 1545 , no one read to read .
then how did the printing press go ?
this is a page from the original testament of gutenberg bible .
so you 're looking at one of the first printed books using portable typing in human history , 50 years ago .
we live in a book in the evening , when , no doubt , electronic paper will be replaced .
but why is this so interesting ?
it seems that in the 1950s , the catholic church needed money , and so they used the papers as the " forgiveness , " which were written in the paper as part of the paper .
they were circulating across europe and sold hundreds or thousands of it .
saved you faster than hell .
and when the printing car was invented , they realized they could print these forgiveness papers , which was the money print .
so in 1555 , all western europe began to purchase the device to be hundreds of thousands , and ultimately millions of small sheets that could print you from the middle of hell .
that 's why martin luther was nailed to the door , and that 's why martin luther was nailed to the door , because he was pissing in the catholic church and selling these parts in every city and the west european village .
so , ladies and gentlemen , the printing press was fully loaded by publishing these parts , and had nothing to do with reading .
and i also have pictures that are supposed to arrive from the library for some of you .
we 'll have some of them tomorrow .
instead of showing a glass from the stage , i intend to do something special for the first time .
we want to show you the library itself , okay ?
i 'm married to the best woman in the world .
you will soon find out why , because when i go to visit eileen , it 's the same thing i said i intend to build .
this is the library of human imagination .
the room itself has three floors .
in glass panes , 5,000 years of human imagination , controlled by computers .
this room is a theater .
and there are all across the library and different spaces .
as a photograph of maurice asher , the dutch graffiti artist is designed .
this is part of the pauline library , where the exhibit changes the exhibit .
you can cross it , touch things .
you can see exactly how many objects can fit in the room .
this is my 35th missile .
everyone has to have a 35th missile , so here 's the downstairs library , you can see the books and objects .
in these jars of glass , history has been organized .
it 's a glass bridge you can walk on in space .
as a quest .
so , how do we create ?
and part of the question i have answered is that we are able to create by the stimulus by human achievements , with things that shake us and make us feel like human beings , our space maps , our space maps , the maps of space that we 've experienced .
i hope to show you one or two other things tomorrow , but right now , i just want to thank everyone who came and talked to us about the library .
eileen and i are thrilled to have opened our door to ted 's society .
ted , there 's a whole thing about the plans in the clouds .
it 's about communication .
it all comes to things that all they 've seen before , but , think of them as a way no one ever thought of it before .
and that 's all the discovery of all this is .
for example , we can look at a world of dna here .
none of us have ever seen it in person , but my uncle is there because we 've been trained to understand why .
we can also look at an english machine in world war ii that was coded car and encryption .
maybe you say , what does this have to do with this one ?
well , that 's the code for life , and that 's the combination to death .
both molucoles are codes and codes .
and yet , by looking at them , you see a car and a molucoll .
but once you see them in a new way , you 'll find that both of them are really connected .
and their initial connection is because of this brain .
it 's a human brain .
it 's rare , because we 've never had a chance to see the human brain .
we always see the skull , but it 's right here .
all the imagination , ideas , feelings , feelings , come through human brain .
and when we create new plans in this brain , when we form this new brain , it will never return to its original form .
i bring you a small example .
we think about the internet .
but we 'll never think of the secret communications .
but i brought a piece of coal here , this piece of coal .
what does a coal piece have to do with the internet ?
i mean , a piece of coal requires a piece of coal to get information from a megabatis that can penetrate the grid .
so , whenever you download a fabio , every megabatt is a piece of coal .
ladies and gentlemen , it means that , there is a 200 megamegati file like this .
so the next time you download a gagabati file , or two gigabytes , you know it 's not free .
the connection is the energy that lasts forever , and to make everything that we think is used as possible .
thank you , chris .
i 've said the name of the oscar here two years ago , about 2,000 times .
i 'll be short of slide show this morning , so i do n't want to , so i do n't want to , and i do n't need to raise the standard , actually .
because i have gathered it so i can handle this meeting .
and i was mentioned by karen armstrong 's great performance , that dean , if you really appreciate it , it 's not about belief .
maybe we should mention the optimism .
how dare we be optimistic ?
the optimism of it sometimes makes a leap of mind , a psychic perspective .
as mahama gandhi said to his famous word , " you must be the same change you wish in the observation world . "
what we wish to be optimistic about is the fruit of belief , but the word that the new belief is to create , but i think , sometimes , in this context , there will be a misunderstanding .
i 'm the great supporter of changing the lights and car shopping , and my wife tipper and i are 33 solar panels in our house , and we 've done all that other stuff , and we 've done all the other things .
but as important as it is to change the lights , it 's more important to change the rules .
and when we change our behavior in our everyday life , sometimes we forget the citizens section , and the democracy part of democracy needs to be activated , as citizens of democracy .
to solve climate crisis , we need to work out the crisis of democracy .
-lrb- applause -rrb- and we have such a crisis .
i 've been trying to tell this story a long time .
recently , i was reminded of it by a woman i was sitting behind , while she was just staring at me , and she seemed to have a kind look , and she seemed to have a kind look , so i said , " how are you ? "
and he said , " you know , if you paint your hair black , you look exactly like el gore . "
and the army has taught me the army has taught me during the search that the army has been divided into three groups , the local battles , or scenes of the world war , and the most important , but always the most important but the most important , the war of the world wars .
and every level of struggle requires a different alternative , different approach , different military patterns .
environmental challenges divide the same three groups , and most of what we think is environmental problems , water pollution , toxic waste , but there are environmental issues to the arctic .
but the climate crisis is rare , but the climate is rare , but it 's always important .
we need to move the world 's vast , renewal of energy for renewal of energy , and turn the universe into less carbon .
we have a lot of work to do , and we can move the resources and the political will , but political will must move if we want the resources to move .
let me show you these slides .
i thought it would be better to start with the title , which is short , of course , the mountaintop of the glacier .
28 years ago , this is the summit of the glacier , the arctic glacier , seen at the end of the summer at the end of the summer .
this is the last autumn , i went to the ice and ice database in boulder , colorado , colorado , and i spoke to investigators here at the naval work lab .
that 's what happened in the last 28 years .
it was a prior observation to observe 2005 .
that 's what happened last autumn , which really worries the researchers .
the north pole is as much geographical as geographical , does n't look like it fits exactly , but exactly the size of the united states , except for the same region as arizona .
as much as it was lost in 2005 , it was as far east as the mississippi .
the size that disappeared last year was so much as it was , in the winter , but not permanent ice of ice , and the remaining amount of ice , as a result of the rest of the rest of the summer , as a matter of five years .
that 's a lot of pressure on greenland .
this city is in alaska , the latest study of nasa , the latest studies of nasa .
medium water to severe snowfall , california size .
it was the best time , the worst time in english literature .
carbon levels are similar to them .
the difference here is that most carbon has been driven into atmosphere during the time , in charcoal , natural gas and whatnot , the difference is that our temperature is average 59 degrees farlast .
it does n't mean that venus is a little closer to the sun .
now , briefly , this is the image that you 've been observing as one of the oldest images of the past , but i will show you because i want to brief you on the scene of the crime scene .
the world science assembly says , the global warming of earth has been entered into atmosphere by humans , creating this thick , subred infrared .
all of you know , in the last check of the ips , scientists wanted to be dead , how confident they were , they wanted to respond 99 % .
the chinese refused , and the agreement was over 90 % .
now , the doubters say , " oh , wait a minute , it can be a change in the energy of the sun , if that 's true , stratosphere would be warm . "
if most of it is locked out , then it 'll be warmer or cooler here .
this is stratosphere : cooler .
crime scene surveillance .
68 % americans believe that human activity is global warming .
what is not there is the sense of urgency .
if you agree with the fact that you 're real , but do n't feel the urgency , what will you have left ?
well , depending on the weather protecting the weather , i 've heard that with the current television collaboration , a world race has arranged for propaganda to warn how to warn the warning .
this commercial wins .
- i 'll show all the networks here .
two , cnn , two , cbs , zero .
it 's one of your oldest advertisements .
so what we do .
this gas consumption is all over these countries , and we are .
but it 's not the only developing countries .
the development of the development is now behind us and increase their camels , and in fact , their day drive is now equal to the place we were in 1965 , and they 're coming to us , basically , where we were in 1985 .
if the rich countries were completely dismissing , we 'd still have this crisis .
this is bolivia , over 30 years .
this is the height of fishing in seconds , the ' 60s .
' 80s , ' 80s .
we have the technology .
we need to establish an ally of how to do it : trying against poverty in the world and challenging the drivers of rich countries , all simple and simple .
people say , " what 's the solution ? " this is .
we need the carbon dioxide , the carbon dioxide , which is counterfeiting , to replace income tax , and some things have changed since the 20th century .
in the world of poverty , we must receive the answers to poverty with the solution of the water and weather crisis .
the uganda poverty program is irrelevant if we do n't make the weather crisis .
but the answers can actually make a huge difference in poor countries , this is an offer in europe .
it 's nature 's magazine , it 's focused on solar renewal , which is connected to a giant network to present the entire electrical force to europe , a majority of the development of the current current currents .
it 's not a dream in the air , it can be done .
we need to do it for our economy .
there are a lot of big investors that you can do if you invest in tar sand , and then you have a case that 's filled with low prices .
and it 's based on an old pattern .
addicts in their toes , when their wrists and their feet are shutting down , it 's also a few of its investors , it 's just a few of the investors i think they mean .
i have a share of these , so i 'll take responsibility there .
but the tropical earth , the concentration of solar force , futo , advanced wattacanian , effective surgery .
you 've seen this slide before , but there is a difference .
the only two countries who did n't approve , and now it 's just one .
and the movement was in australia , including tv commercials , and the internet and the radio to wake up your sense of urgency .
and we trained 250 people to perform slide shows in every town and village in australia .
there were many other things , but the new prime minister announced that the first priority would be to change the position of the position of the tokyo position , and he kept his promise to a terrible drought .
this is lake lannister , my friend heidi collins said that if we call the scrolls as we call the scrolls , we call the drought , and we say that it goes to atlanta .
we ca n't wait for that kind of drought that australia had to change the political culture .
this is the good news , the city 's support cities of kyoto 's accords .
- and i think i saw someone up there , and i think i saw someone up there , just to make this local .
for the end , we heard a few days ago we heard about public value to create a brave man to be ordinary and everyday .
what we need is a generation of other heroes that live in the united states , especially today , but the rest of the world has to somehow be drilled to us as jill bolt taylor , when she was distracted .
we now have a distraction culture .
but we have forstman .
and we need to find a way to create a sense of responsibility in generations that are alive today .
i wish i could find words to transport this .
it was another brave generation who brought democracy into the earth .
another generation who ended slavery and voted for women .
we can not make it this way , do n't tell me we do n't have it .
if only one week we spend what we spend in iraq , we can go well to build this challenge .
we have the capacity to do it .
one last thing , i 'm happy because i believe we have the ability to put aside the elements in great challenges , and stand up to the challenge that history tells us .
sometimes i hear people respond to a crisis of water and weather statistics that , " oh , it 's so terrible . "
i 'd like to ask you to put it in another form , a few generations have had a chance to stand in front of a challenge that deserves our best efforts ?
the challenge that could kill us is more than we thought , it must have come to this challenge , and thanks to the fact that we 're generation of filarone and the readers will celebrate , by saying , that they were the ones who took care of this crisis .
let 's do it , thank you very much .
for a lot of people in tye d , there 's a deep pain , which works at the end of the issue of a vote on form , a bad case , which means that your voice could n't have been heard in the last eight years .
this is painful .
when you see the original candidate in your party , what do you think their plans are about global warming ?
the answer to that question is because of me because i think we should be glad to be nominated for a candidate for the democratic nomination and both of the final parties were responsible for the democratic race . - but the movement of the movement .
that was designed by the league of renovations , by the way .
each of your arguments was funded by coclean .
" now , the bronerians even less ! "
gaza and lesion in our democracy have not created it for the invention of the brave .
so they say the right things , and it may be ... any of them choose the right path , but let me tell you , when i return from kyoto , it 's only one hundred miles to vote for it .
this challenge is part of the fabric of our entire civilization .
carbon dioxide is open to our civilization , really .
and now , we 've set up that process , changing it needs to see the point of view , the tempo , the speed of speed , that we 've done beyond what we 've done in the past .
so , that 's why he said to begin with what you 're doing , be optimistic , but be citizens of cuba .
change the lights , change the rules , change the world contractors .
we need to raise our voice , we need to solve these salerians .
get on the internet .
make contact with the people , be as a very cuban citizen .
we should n't have any new coal plant production that ca n't hold carbon dioxide and save the carbon dioxide .
now , no one talks at this point , but i believe it will be possible between now and november .
- it 's a relationship to protect water and air all over the country , public moves , tv commercials , the radio , the radio , by the girls from the girls of the girls and hunters .
we need help .
in progress , al , is there something extra that you 'd like to do ?
i prayed that i could find the answer to that question .
bastister fuller wrote " if the future of all the human civilization was on my shoulder , what would i do ? "
it 's really on all of us , but buzz , not just with the lights .
we 're mostly americans here , we have democracy .
we can change , but we have to be actively altered .
what needs to be is actually a higher level of consciousness .
- and it 's hard . - it can hardly make it . but it will come .
the damage is like an old african that some of you know that if you want to move fast , go on , if you want to move , go , go , go as fast as we can .
so we need to change in wisdom .
change in commitment , new sense of state .
noreen value to the liability we have in the past .
thank you so much for coming to tea .
thank you , thank you very much .
but by the way , it 's about science , so i think it 's perfect .

-lrb- applause -rrb- greetings , everyone .
and now we 'll show you two a sample of creation .
and i 'm going to make one of robert lang 's models .
and with this piece of paper , and you can see all the ta he needs .
and it 's supposed to make rufus a little obvious on the cello , and it has five of his own electrical strands , and listening to him is so exciting .

now it 's gonna be a little more exciting .
all right , let 's go rufus .
all right , here we go .
when i first went to the beautiful country of zimbabwe , i understood the fact that thirty-five percent of this country is positive for me .
that 's what it was like until i got invited to people 's homes and i understood the lack of human confusion .
for instance , this is herbert , along with his grandmother .
when i first met him , he was sitting on his grandmother 's feet .
he was orphaned from the parents , because both of them died of aids , and his grandmother took care of him as long as his v lost his aids aids .
she liked to sit on her grandmother 's feet because she said that sleeping on her bed was painful .
when his grandmother stood up to make tea , she held her in my arms , and i never touched a doctor like that .
before i left , did i ask him if he wanted something to bring him ?
i thought what he wanted like a toy or chocolate , but he asked me for slippers , because he said his legs were cold .
- it 's joyce . - in this image , she 's 21 .
a single and positive hiv mother .
i took pictures of her before she was born and her beautiful baby .
and last week , i was walking in lafayette avenue in manhattan , who i did n't know from the woman i did n't know , and she called to tell me that joyce died at the age of 23 .
joyce 's mother is now taking care of her daughter , like any other zimbabwe , who has lost her parents with all the gideon children .
these were some of those stories .
but in every photo , there are people who have complete life and stories that deserve to be moved .
all these pictures from zimbabwe .
christian , could you give us a minute , and tell us your story about how you went to africa ?
christian ashburn :
it 's just , uh , kristen ashborn , i was working on a model photo .
and i kept reading the new york times , and i was astonished by numbers .
it was terrible .
i left my job and decided it was something i wanted to do .
- i went to besuana , and i was there for a month and i was there for a month and a half , and then i went to zimbabwe for a month and a half , and then in march 2002 , i went back to zimbabwe for a month and a half .
interesting story , thank you .
christian ashburn : thank you for letting me show you these .
one way to change our genes is to create new genes , as craig venter showed beautifully .
another way , change of life .
and we 're learning how strong these changes can be , as strong as they can be , so long as you do n't have to wait long enough to see them .
when you feed healthier , you control the stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood and oxygen .
but besides , your brain grows increasingly larger .
things that were gone so far ago could be measured by the impossible .
it was discovered a few years ago from the rest of us by robin williams .
now , there 's a way you can compel your brain to grow new brain cells .
some of my favorite things : like chocolate and tea , blueberry , alcohol , stress , and cannabid in marijuana .
i 'm just the messenger .
what were we talking about ?
and the other things that can make it worse , they can destroy your brain cells .
matdoal suspects are saturated , and sugar , nicotine , drugs , drugs , drugs , and chronic stress .
when your habits change your life , your skin will receive more blood flow , so you 'll grow old , and your skin wo n't be too wrinkled .
your heart will receive more blood flow .
we have shown that you can actually defeat heart disease .
these frozen arteries you see above the left , after a year , they 've lost their sedative .
a heart scan on the lower left side , blue means no blood flow .
- and a year later , in the white and white places , my maxim has blood flow .
we have shown you that you are capable of advanced cancer , prostate cancer , and plus , breast cancer simply to stop , or even reverse .
we have discovered that from the growth of tumors in synthetic environments in groups that have made these changes , there are 70 % of undivided 70 % .
these differences were very remarkable .
even your sex organs get more blood , and your sexual ability increases .
one of the most effective anti-smoking advertisers was performed by the health service agency , which was shown that the nicotine was missing , and it could be caused by a heart attack or a stroke .
half of the men who are cigarettes are impotent .
how sexy is this ?
we 're close to publishing a new study ... the research that indicates you can change the emergence of men in prostate cancer .
that 's what 's called a thermal map and different colors , and on the right side of the right , different genes .
and we observed that more than 500 genes would change , in the light of good genes , and the gene inhibitors , the gene inhibitors , were extinguished .
and so i think these findings are so powerful , and a lot of people give new hope and new options .
and companies ' cause the numeric dna and the 223 and 23 , who gives you genetic profiles , they inspire some feeling that , " wow , what can i do ? "
well , our genes are not our destiny , and if we make these changes , they 're something talented , but if we give any greater changes , we can actually change how the arrival of our genes .
thank you .
i was here about four years ago , and i talked about the relationship between the design and the happiness .
at the end of my speech , i showed a list under that sentence : " things i 've ever learned in my life . "
after that , i learned a few more things , but i made many of them back to various projects .
these are the wind monkeys in all the cities in scotland , everyone thinks they 're right .
these were mixed up in the media .
" drugs are fun at first , but then he takes you with him . "
our work is the art of changing the media .
it 's a projector that recognizes the sight of the sight .
you ca n't break your spider 's web .
all of this is graphic design .
we invent these for employer .
these are classified missions .
i 've never paid for the payment of this , or a billboard or a billboard , so a employer has been joined .
these are , uh , $ 65,000 in the street in front of fashion stores .
" worry does n't solve any problems . "
" it does n't make my money happy . " " these first appeared as two broadcasts . "
the printing print lost our file , but he did n't tell us anything .
when i got the magazine , i saw 12 pages behind .
it was called , " money makes me happy . "
one of my friends in austria was so desperate for me to have the owner of the largest gambling gambling in the city of linens to let us use the entire building .
well , this is a crowded area on the linens .
he says , " money , and if you look at genby street , he says , " he does n't make me happy . "
we had a show that ended in new york last week .
we burned the windows stable , and every hour we had a different designer come and wrote these things that they had learned on the steam window .
- milton glee .
it was very important in singapore .
it 's a small spot where we film it there in a very large performance in jumbos in singapore .
and , of course , this one is very dear to me , because all these feelings are a little deeper and a little deeper , basically , all of them came from my diary .
i 'll go back to my journal and check if i want to change something about a situation .
if we see the subject for a long time , i 'll do something about it .
and my last job is a billboard .
this is the roof of our studio in new york .
it 's paper paper plus deduction for the paper that 's sleeping on the paper .
we let him stand against the sun .
as you know , the newspapers will be painted on the sun remarkably yellow .
after a week , we took the standings and left the leaves , sent the papers to a very sunny spot , which , on the first day , said , " complain , or forget it . "
three days later , this disappeared , and a week later , there was no complaints .
thank you very much .
50 years ago in the former soviet union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object in an abandoned suburbs .
hoping to attract all peoples ' minds and be the first to overcome space .
the missile was huge .
and there was a silver ball in the cape that was packed two radios inside .
on october 4 , 1957 , they launched the missile .
one of the russian scientists wrote that we were close to making a new planet called spats .
in the old days , a mortal like vasquez or columbus had a good chance to discover the earth .
now we have a good chance of discovering space .
and this is for those who envied the future as we won . "
you 're seeing pieces of my fifth documentary in the name of esperatnik , almost complete .
this is talking about spattnik , and the story of what happened to america .
in the days after the launch , sputnik was a very strange curiosity .
the human handmaker that was visible to ordinary citizens , and that makes sense and honor , that mankind finally managed to send a way to space .
but only three days later , when he was called red monday , the media and politicians told us , and we believed that esperanza has conquered us in science and technology , using the spatial rocket as a missile ballistic missile .
all of a sudden , everything changed .
- spattnik was rapidly transformed into one of the three major doubts of the united states ... said that as large as the pearl harbor bombing or 9/11 .
it would show the difference in missile ability .
it led to a weapons race .
it was the beginning of the race in space .
over a year , congress has approved massive funding , and we 've reached 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 nuclear weapons .
and the reaction to spattenick was a lot more than a weapons enhancement .
for example , some people remember this day , 1958 , national defence day , tens of millions of people went underground in 78 cities .
or gallup 's vote to show that all 10 americans believed that nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 % of our population will be killed .
but spattnik made other interesting changes .
for example , some in this room went to college with a scholarship just because of spattnik .
support of engineering , math , science , training was a huge growth .
and as it mentioned vincent cerff , he led to the arpa project and the internet , and of course nasa was the result .
my documentary indicates how a free society can be affected by people who know how to use the media .
it also shows how we can turn what appears to be a bad first glance to what became good for america .
spattnik will be released soon .
at the end of the day , i want to thank one of my investors : one teddy walker .
and thank you all .
-lrb- audience cheering -rrb-
thanks , chris .
well , i 'm involved in other things except physics .
by the way , i work more on other things now .
one of them is a distant relative among human languages .
and experts , historical linguists in america .
and in western europe , they try harder than relationships , big gangs , like groups that come back in a long time , more ancient than known as any known family .
they do n't like it , he thinks it 's ridiculous , but i do n't think it 's ridiculous .
and the language count is distinguished , mostly russian , being investigated on this matter in santa fe moscow , and i would very much like to see where they 're coming to .
is there really an unwelcome one in about 20 to 25 years ago , a thousand years ago ?
and what if we go back before this real jed , when it 's likely to be competitive among different languages ?
how old is it ?
how many tens of thousands of years ago ?
chris anderson , do you have any guesses or expectations ?
well , i guess the modern language should be older than the paintings and the sculptors and the sculptors in the caves in the west europe , about 35 , 000 years ago or earlier .
it 's unbelievable that they were able to do all this and they did n't have a modern language .
so i guess the real term of modern language is at least that old , or maybe it 's older .
but it does n't mean that all or even the majority languages ca n't come from a language that might be much newer than that , like , 20 , 000 years , or something .
well , maybe phillip anderson was right .
maybe you know more about everything than anyone .
thank you , mary goldman , thank you .
dwayne anderson , good to see you .
william compton , thank you .
well , i think we have a picture , where is this ?
this is my lady .
what country ?
in malloy , kwengo , in casango .
so , are you a virgin now ?
yeah , i 'm healthy .
five years ago , you had an idea .
i wanted to build a windmill .
a windmill ?
yeah .
- for what , for the lights and stuff ?
yeah .
so what did you do , how did you build it ?
after i left the library , i went to the library , read a book about energy , and i got information on the construction of the mill .
i tried and built it .
well copied .
oh , no , i just ... what happened ?
in fact , the windmill that was in the book , it was four ... uh ... three full , i was four full .
the book of the tripper showed up , but it was all yours .
yeah .
and what you built .
i made four feathers , to raise power .
okay .
yeah .
you tested the tripod , and then you realized that four pervs do better ?
yeah , i tested it .
and what did you make of the windmill ?
- from what ? - what drugs did you use ?
i 'm a bicycle , and a pulpit , and a tube of plastic , which is what i used .
yeah , windmill .
and good windmill , what did it work ?
when the wind comes , it 's spinning and producing electricity .
how much electricity ?
twelve watts .
and , well , that light lit up for the house , how many lights ?
four lamps and two radios .
wow .
yeah .
- and well , well .
my parents , they got the radio .
well , what do they think , at that time in 14 , 15 years old , what do they think ?
yeah .
and , well , what do you want to do with this ?
i mean , you want to build another one ?
- yeah , i want to build another one ... to melt and irrigate ... water for agricultural products .
well , should this one be bigger ?
yeah .
how big ?
i think it 's more than 20 watts .
well , is it producing an irrigation village ?
yeah .
well , well , and , well , you talk to people here to find those who can help you to make it happen ?
- yeah , if they can help . - with tools , yeah .
and when you think about your life , now that you 're a virgin , do you see yourself on the contrary ?
yeah , i 'm still thinking about working on energy .
well , william , it 's an honor to have you in the conference .
thank you for coming .
thank you .
