you did n't start three minutes yet , did you ?
yeah , you ca n't start anywhere .
set it three minutes , this is foul .
oh , my god , it 's cold here .
i 'm so nervous .
but not like five weeks ago .
i had a post-op hip surgery five weeks ago .
do you know what the surgery is ?
and if you 're david vollin , the drill drill , it 's terrible , but it 's beautiful , and it 's beauty , and it 's beauty .
yes , david , if this is n't your pelvis , the truth is , it 's beautiful .
anyway , in this situation , i had a great deal of trouble , so chris invited me to talk about it .
but first you need to know something about me .
just two .
i 'm canadian , and youngest of the seven children .
now , there 's a great medical system in canada .
which means canadian pelvis can have a new pelvis .
and i 've never been in the front row of the seven , you know ?
i 've been through my pelvis for years .
i finally went to the doctor , of course , free .
and the doctor recommended ortho surgery .
ten months , almost a year , and i went to see a friend surgeon .
it 's a price for free .
i 've had an x-ray shoot for a pro x-ray , and you know , i 'm working on the x-rays , and you know i 'm working in marketing .
he says , " allison , we 're gonna operate on you . "
i 'm going to replace your pelvis , but you need to wait for 18 months .
18 months .
i 've been waiting 10 months , but we 're gonna wait for 18 months .
you know , it 's a long time , considering ted , actually .
i would n't have had a new pelvis for ted here .
i would n't have had a new pelvis for my own .
i would n't have had a new pelvis for ted 2008 .
i was still holding my pain pelvis , which was disappointing .
i got out of the pit , and i walked into the hospital , and i realized something .
my youngest was supposed to be out of front of the seven .
that 's right .
did i tell you what the hell the canadian people are ?
we do n't think that way .
we do n't even talk about it .
in fact , it 's a way we can tell us who we are traveling abroad .
" no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
hey , i 'm canadian !
nice to meet you !
but i just thought i 'd push you out of the way of some old man .
it 's a 70 year old , who wants to have a new pelvis , which is why we can do the golf or the garden .
no , the front row .
until then , i was walking robbie , and of course i suffered because of my pelvis , and i needed a sign .
and i saw a sign .
there was a little gift at the hospital that says that there was a sign of volunteers there .
yeah , i was hired right now .
you do n't need your career , or a common level of identity .
they really needed volunteers , because when i was 75 , the average volunteers store was 75 .
yeah , they needed a young blood .
so , i had a bright blue volunteer for the bright blue service jacket , and i was trained from the 89 years old boss .
i worked alone .
every friday morning , i was at the gift shop .
when i hear a guy eating candy at the hospital , i 'm just saying , " what are you doing ? "
and then , they said , " well , i 'm gonna fix my ass in 18 months . "
if this is stopping , it 's gonna be awesome . ooh !
every employee has been given to know the young volunteers .
the next surgeon 's appointment with a surgeon , it was a surprise , and it was next time at work .
so , naturally , i wear my vest , my id card .
i put my clothes on in the pit seat .
and when the doctor came in , i saw the things he put him on .
for a while , i was scheduled for surgery for a few weeks , and i got a prescription for pecco set .
now , there 's this story where my volunteer work brings me in the front row .
and , as you know , i was n't ashamed .
for two reasons .
first of all , i 'm gonna keep this new pelvis really well .
and also , i will continue to volunteer to volunteer because that service was leading me to the biggest .
if the canadian of canada breaks the rules , that 's why it helps the society .
hello , everyone , can you wave your hands up , like i do ?
you can always follow what you see in your eyes .
you can do what you have to do with hundreds of muscles of your arms .
sooner or later , you can look into your muscles and look into the territory of brains and control the territory .
this is the subject of the technology i 'd like to introduce you today .
people wanted to read their brains and minds for thousands of years .
the solution to this day has begun to see this today .
a lot of people think it 's a very difficult job to read the brain .
i mean , i usually think it 's the only way to put a little capsule in the vessels and put a little capsule in the vessels .
it 's a very dangerous job because your body could get the attack from the white blood attack .
but now it 's developed technology that 's avoiding the trouble .
let 's get you into peter 's brain .
an m.r.i. will look into peter 's brain .
there 's no need to put in any kind of radiation or use radiation .
we can see peter 's brain structure as much as we can see , but the important thing here is that we can read peter 's heart .
when peter moves his arm , there 's a yellow part of peter 's brain , this is a yellow part of his arm , and it 's showing his arm where the brain is activated .
you 're already aware that you 're already using the electrode and the brain scanner and the brain scanner and realize that you can see the internal structure of the brain 's internal structure .
this technology and the combined technology take a few months in a few months .
it 's a fact that peter 's been able to see the changes in his brain scanner , and that 's where peter can see the changes in his brain .
he can detect access to an 60,000 brain activation of the first five per hour .
like this , the pattern of the brain can learn how to control his brain .
it has three ways to change the brain , the drug , the drug , and the hospital in the hospital .
this technique can be another way to change the brain .
we know that we are forming to the brain in the brain and change the fact that it 's changed .
let 's hear it with the chronic pain .
but in six months or six years , if it 's still suffering , it creates a false circuit in the brain .
if you can find a part of the brain that 's been regenerated during the pain , it can be seen in a 3-d model that can cause information that can cause information from inside the brain .
put your hand back up and bend your arms .
imagine that now that you can continue your arms in your brain and continue your arms activated when you bend your arms .
what you see right now is picking up the path of chronic pain patient 's brain .
maybe it 's a bit shocking , but we 're actually reading this man 's brain in real time .
patients look at their brains and control the path to the pain that caused the pain to cause the pain itself .
it 's to control the system that creates a permanent sedative .
on the left side on the left side , we can see the contents of the brain that controls the brain .
you control your brain , you can control your pain at the same time .
this technology was n't finished yet , but this whole clinical trial has been able to reduce 44 % of our clinical trial in 44 % .
this technique is not a movie matrix , only you can control his brain .
i 've already looked into my brain , and you will be here soon .
what do you want to control when that day comes ?
you will see the experience that you 've been through to yourself .
i do n't have time for any more specifics , but i ca n't be more specific .
i 'd like to throw you some distance for you last time .
we will be the first generation to look into this ... technology through the human brain and mind .
how do we use this technology forward ?
in a year ago , he visited me in the high line of defense .
he was to me , one of the men who were deployed , " 600 and 600 . "
the whole arms under the shoulder .
so we 're just putting the stick and hook on the civil war as well as the civil war .
they deserve better . "
this is my office in new hampshire in new hampshire , and i need you to develop your arm , and i want you to know that that 's raisins , not to see the grapes on the table . "
which means that motor nerves , neuronerves , and the catalyzing response to all of them .
after his description , i expected 300 pounds of paperwork to offer , but he said , " that 's what i want you to do . "
i said , " look , you 're crazy , that 's not the current technique .
impossible .
" we ca n't get a profit on at the end of the human shoulders like a human arm . "
he said , " one of 600 men , 20 men , lost both arms .
you think it 's unfortunate to lose one arm ?
it 's just a uncomfortable thing to lose both arms . "
i have a job during the day and the night and the weekend with water and energy , and i do n't want to talk about another mission , chris .
i 've been thinking about those young men who lost my arm .
he said , " we 've been prepared all over the country .
we have the best neurosurgeon and many experts in the field . "
so i said i 'd walk around and ready to see what it is .
the next month , i 've been visiting all over the country and found the best of the best .
i went to washington and talked to them , and we did what you asked for .
i still think you 're crazy , but it 's not as much as i thought . "
i 've moved up a team about 13 months ago , and i 've saved 20 people .
we said that he would build a device that he wants .
we do n't need the last two fingers , but we 've made it 14 suicidal prey .
after we put together this device ,
a few weeks ago , i took the army medical center a few weeks ago , and this is an unfortunate topic on the news lately .
we showed the people there that we built the device we built .
one person said he was lucky because he 's right-handed , and he lost his left arm .
he sits in bed with seven or eight different people at the table .
he said it was lucky to leave his right arm and moved the table behind the back of the table .
these guys really ca n't believe it .
now , i 'm gonna show you that the device does n't have any blood on you , the video takes 30 seconds , and i 'm gonna make it up .
but you understand , what you see is that it 's a little bit small to be beaten to the average woman who can handle me .
based on the c.t. and mri of the other normal arm and mri and an mri , then we wrap it up inside the device .
so you guys ca n't see this beautiful 14 drive , and it 's got an open temperature and pressure and pressure .
also , this device is support with a shoulder muscle to operate into the compreair air , and the more powerful he gets , the more powerful he gets .
once he 's gone , he 'll be recalling again .
let me show you a few simple moves we produced in washington ?
look at your finger , your thumb , your wrist , your wrist .
the weight is 3.1 pounds .
i can scratch your nose .
with 14 active activity , sir .
now raise a pen with your thumb and your thumb .
put down a piece of paper and a piece of paper and a reading , read it , read it .
-lrb- applause -rrb- my job is a venture investor , a lot of rockets on the weekends .
i like the pictures , and i like the rockets , and today i 'd like to spend the last few years with you , and i 'd like to spend the last couple of years with these kids .
my son 's got a golf ball rocket , which is pretty steady , which is quite interesting to be an arrow into an arrow with an arrow .
this is a rocket with baking soda and vinegar .
it 's a great rocket to fire at night and across the galaxy and the milky way to cross the milky way and the milky way .
there 's a two-inch rocket attached to the video , with a computer record that can land in the ground , it 's a rocket shuttle .
we 're going to do a simulation of the simulation that we 're able to do before we can shoot the rocket , and then we 're going to have a computer scan on the rocket 's actual performance computer .
but if you want to fire the big guy , you must get out of the way to the black rock .
when the kids grow up , the rockets start with the motor , and they start using the motor , and they 're actually using the thrusters literally .
when a rocket like this is fired , it looks like thunderstorms , even a man who takes pictures .
these rockets were used using an experimental system using an aanadas .
it 's used from the high metal fuel .
maybe it 's a little weird .
you want to know more about this site on the site called com .
we call ourselves " rocket " and " rocket . "
it 's been over 3,000 meters , and then the fall is burned down to the ground , like a missile that breaks the bunker and pulls it out of the ground .
if we put too much fuel on the rocket , sometimes we get out of control .
it was like a race race .
in the day , i can tell what 's going on , and in the day , they 'll call me " shark shark . "
there 's a time when it explodes in front of the snow , and it 's time to crash .
there are some things i do to take pictures of this kind of picture , hiding in the back of nowhere .
i can show you how the video looks like a movie like a movie .
wow , good .
it 's rare .
damn it .
this is when the computer program is all wrapped up all tangled up .
oh , shit .
i do n't have to say it more .
no !
up , up , up , up !
you 're the one that 's putting all this into a picture .
sometimes things do n't work out .
some people hit the rockets like a race car , blew up , and the chute likes to see how the chute burned , and it was last week .
this rocket ran into the sky with supersonic , supersonic , and the rocket wings fell off the fire .
if you keep firing the rockets every weekend , you 'll have no idea what you 're imagining .
you can feel what it 's like to feel like rhythm .
i 'm trying to take pictures of a bad lab , and it 's not easy for all this happening , but it 's not easy for all these things to take .
it 's probably because of the blood flow in my body , it 's an x-ray sensor , video camera , and a faint little blue belt that led to the universe .
in fact , it 's a reminder that the children are able to understand the great pictures of the rocket science , which is a reminder that the children who have lived in their first generation , they realize physics and mathematics , the most important thing they 've ever known is physics . yes , sir .
thank you .
if we do n't take action , for 40 years , we 're going to see a neurological disease in the earth .
it 's a pleasure to think about it .
it 's more than 20 % of the entire population of the population in the green capital of this map .
we 're living in this world .
your children will be living in this world .
in the past 12 years , the age of human race , and when the population went up on top of it , it was a pyramid shape .
now it 's flat .
in 2050 , it 'll be a top vertical , it 'll turn to it .
why is this happening ?
the average life expectancy is stretched both twice in the age of 1840 .
but it 's not just a happy thing to be able to afford the life of life , because it 's been exponentially , which is exponential to get alzheimer 's disease and pakeson disease .
in 2050 , population of the population will only be $ 3200 million from the population if we do n't do something , and half of it will take alzheimer 's .
it 's $ 3 billion dollars per year for a neurological disease that could n't be treated today .
but in 2050 , we 'll have a trillion bucks in 2050 .
alzheimer 's disease is a disease that changes the shape of a certain amount of proteins that are unattached to a certain amount of protein .
one option is the only solution to the molecular level of the molecular tape in molecular levels that allows the role of a scotch tape .
it would stop the process of destroying each of the brain 's structure of the brain .
in fact , the fact that the fact that affects other parts of the brain is that it may be a common procedure , not just alzheimer 's , not just alzheimer 's , not just alzheimer 's .
this story is actually connected to cancer because people with neurological diseases are n't gonna take a lot of cancer .
now , i do n't have any research on this connection , but it 's interesting .
most importantly , most of the most creative work in the field is just complete support of charity business .
in fact , the government does n't have a proper support on this area , and it 's not a good situation , but it 's not a good situation .
meanwhile , in the future , i 'll explain a few things that you can do on your own .
if you 'd like to reduce the possibility of the damage to parkinson 's disease , caffeine will help you , but it does n't make any sense .
it 's not good to hurt your head , it 's connected to parkinson 's disease .
the avian flu affects the effect .
first of all , i 'll tell you what 's going on with alzheimer 's , the fish oil , that 's good for alzheimer 's disease .
the high blood pressure is the most critical risk that has been connected to alzheimer 's with alzheimer 's .
well , you need to be careful with a man who has a green innards , green , and the alzheimer 's disease is alzheimer 's .
it 's your heart , but it 's important , but the point is , the point is , what matters is that we have to focus on this kind of precaution .
you know , you 're gonna have to talk to me about taking precautions .
you heard the story .
and last time , wish me luck to the research , okay ?
we do n't have much time left now .
thank you .
how are you ?
i 'm going to take a look at one of the greatest heroes in the history of leonardo da vinci .
we all know his marvelous work of his work , his rage , his rage , and the lore .
but we do n't know his face .
there are so many books about him , but still more controversy about his looks .
even if this famous portrait of this famous portrait is n't leonardo darvinci 's face .
what do you think of you ?
maybe this is leonardo dahda 's face or maybe ?
we 'll find out together .
da vinci is the one who drew everything around him .
i used to hit everything with people and plants , and the landscape , the landscape , the landscape , the landscape , and the water .
but was it as exception as the face ?
well , that 's why it 's hard to convince you .
the other painter who lived in the village , he painted your face as you see , and there 's a portrait of a 77th portrait .
given the fact that the da vinci was a passionate painter , and the da vinci painted a picture of his portrait .
now , we 're gonna have to find out the portrait .
if he 's looking at all his work , he may be able to find his face , and we may find his face .
so i found out that one of his paintings of a man over a man 's paintings first .
you 've been in 120 together with the bar .
which one of these people is a self-portrait of vinci ?
as long as we 've seen it before , we have to be a facial portrait .
by the side of the side , we can rule out the portrait .
and you need to stay sharp enough .
therefore , we can rule out or rule out the disgraceful images .
and according to them , da vinci was a very handsome and beautiful man .
therefore , the ugly faces can consume them .
there are only three candidates who meet the criteria .
this is the same as the one you see here .
there 's also a portrait of the old man who saw the old man , including a famous pen in vinci .
the last time , he also has a portrait of a man named da vinci .
before you take a look at each faces , i think you have to explain to me why i deserve this subject .
in the last 300 years , i 'm sorry for your portrait , not the last 300 years .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- there 's no painter with many faces like this .
so in experience , i know a little bit about the face and analysis .
back to the chase , i 'll take a look at the portrait of this three portrait .
if we can zoom in , the three faces are all hanky-hang-faced forehead , side to the side of the head , and small , but small and small .
when i first saw this , i could n't doubt my eyes .
because the three portrait of these three have had nothing to do with each other .
we just found a portrait of a portrait of self-own burns , and i 'm surprised that the faces in the arts were very similar .
how 's it going to work ?
first of all , this young man should be completed first .
as we can see from this work here , it 's true .
these things are done in the order of the right order .
how old is the da vinci at the time at the time , is that a match for that ?
yes , yes , at the time this portrait was painted , 38 , 38 , and 63 .
in order to clean it up , we have three paintings of the three of us who have a third portrait of the same person who painted the same man and age of vinci .
so how do you know that this person is n't someone else 's da vinci ?
to do that , you need a judgment .
there 's only a photograph here that most of this is called the da vinci .
it was a model of david 's wach , 15 years old , a model of a model , a model of a model , a model of a model .
compared to the face of this statue 's face , that looks very similar to me once again .
this is to connect the three portrait of this statue to leonardo da vinci 's portrait .
gentlemen , what i 've been saying is that it has n't been public yet , and i 'm the first person here who has the ted in this place .
because i thought it was right to get into this .
finally , we found the right face of the right men .
this is leonardo merda .
the only thing that used it to the south africans in south africa has hundreds of years .
but we 've got a whole new materials called " front line " for the lines .
in the country of the city , the producer of the city have become difficult to save the natural population , and these new businesses have been taken place .
now , let 's see how we change the modern ingredient .
these are manufactured in the 1950s in 1940 .
in the 1990s , i was with a series of interest and passionate and passionate of a new art brief from the city outside of the market outside of the market .
then i had a chance to work with the community , and i began to develop a lot of business , a lot of work , and i began to develop a lot of men 's design .
after that , the project was made in five of the producers that the producer had turned to 50 people .
soon we burn all the walls that we can use , and we have to put pressure on our own colors not to supply our own colors in the open cable .
at the same time , i was thinking that i have a lot of potential to get away from the kind of civilization .
so , i am able to satisfy all the many markets to the mayor and the mayor of water and the mayor that fit in a much luxurious decorations , and i 've developed a large piece of production of production of mass production of mass production of the market .
as you can see now , we 've done a lot of experiments , shape , and extremely important projects , and the result has been successful , and we have been successful . he 's got a joint store in a designer 's mall , which is great .
this is our group , and these are our top producers .
these guys come to half a half week .
everyone has a bank account .
everyone moved back to the local area .
production of production is over a week .
this is the present of the village where the town showed up on the slide .
this is also modern , very modern , and 300 producer lives alive .
it 's strange , by the screen , as a part of this project , my life has changed my life .
thank you .
you know how passionate you are to know me to open the territory of the universe in space .
when i had a chance to learn the gravity of this world , it was hard to believe .
that 's why i want to talk about it .
i met him the first time i met him , it was through the prime minister x x .
it 's a contest that we played , the second ecstasy , that prime minister of the prime minister takes 100 human genome mapping in order .
we call it the same genome in the genome , but 100 individual genome has decided to be part of that contest .
craig benchventer is leading that event .
so i met the professor , he told me that his dream was traveling into space .
so i said , " i ca n't take you there , but i ca n't take you into it . "
and then he said yes to say yes to " yes . "
there 's only one way to experience gravity on the surface of the earth , that 's actually a la ebola .
when people fly on the plane , they fly to the top of the air , he 'll be out of the state for 25 seconds .
when he comes back , he 's twice weight .
if you keep doing it ,
in ten minutes , it 's the way the u.s. flight has been trained to train their astronauts for a long time .
we designed this method .
it took 11 years to make it work .
so we announced that we were gonna fly from stephen hawking .
one of the government has a pilot who has a plane pilot , and they 're not saying , " you 're out of your mind . "
he wanted to go .
we got all the permits on the end .
so , after six months , we got the kennedy space center in the space of the space center .
i 've had a press conference , and we 've announced that we intend to do one of the first stages of la bobollah for 25 seconds .
if the first flight is fully successful , we 'll be able to do a third week of parbollah 's flight .
we asked him why he wanted to fly away .
what he said , it was very impressive for me .
he said , " the life on earth is increasing the risk of increased disaster to take away from disaster . "
i think if we do n't go into space , humanity does n't exist .
that 's why i want to encourage people 's attention to the universe .
we came up to the kennedy space center to get him to the us space center , took him back to the us flight to the united states plane to the united states plane .
for us , we had 20 charity money for a child 's charity , and we took over $ 150 donation to children 's charity group .
a few minutes of the ted family here .
we 've been able to rig the er at all .
on the plane , there were two in the e.r. doctors and two doctors .
we were checking the blood oxygen , the heartbeat rate , his blood rate .
you know , in case of emergencies , in case of emergency , the god of the world will know that god is not going to get hurt .
we took off from a space landing facility , which is where the space shuttle takes off and land .
my partner and i were very careful with him .
as soon as he was in the air , he let him go to a certain gravity situation that could have occurred to him that the gravity was actually doing what it actually was .
after the first time , you 've been smiling , and you 've been smiling , and we 've decided to keep going .
that 's why we 've been on the second flight bobollah 's flight .
that 's a smile , and third .
and we applaud the apology for isaac newton , because professor isaac newton has the exact same old chairman of isaac newton .
and we 've been on number four , number five , and the sixth flight .
the smile and the seventh and the eighth .
but he does n't look like an old man stuck in a wheelchair .
he was so happy .
we live in a very valuable jewels , and we are going to be moving to this earth all our lives .
with this great adventure .
oh , my god .
in the first time , they do n't respond to their children .
if you 're the most precious resource to me , you will agree to that , if that 's what happens to you .
today we are traveling with the army of colombia and police and the police of the police and the police , and today we 're trying to deliver the 650 laptop to the kids who have n't been cut off from the past 40 years .
it 's important to provide a laptop in this region to connect the children to the world 40 years ago , after 40 years ago , the children have been cut off to the bottom of the world .
there are 10 billion children in the world , and 50 % of them are living in a house without electricity .
and some countries in afghanistan do n't go to school in 75 % of the women 's kids .
not from the third grade . not in the third grade . not from the beginning .
three years ago , i offered to offer some samples , started with the idea that began with the idea of the actual laptop .
today , 50 million laptop computers have been held in their hands .
and , uh , computer computer computer computers are being delivered to the kids , and the computer computer computers are designed by the quarter point now .
finally , a hundred million laptop computers are provided by their children .
this levels , it 's smaller than i expected , but it 's still 100 million , but it 's still 100 grand .
in colombia , the children will offer three thousand to the children .
we 're working with the secretary of defense , not the minister of education , not the minister of education , which is why the training minister has been in a completely isolated area .
and then suddenly , the children in the area had their laptop computers .
they 're going to be able to communicate with the first culture of the cultural advancement .
this change is a very unique thing , because it 's not an open opening , because it 's an opening to another world .
they 're building the road , and they 're setting up the phone , and they 'll have the television .
and in six years , the kids are going to surf with the spanish language and the local language of the world , so children will grow up with an open spear .
before they were cut off to the world .
and in other countries , in other countries , it will be done by the minister of economic growth .
and the drive will show up in 20 years .
you know , this is not a year 's work , but this is a very important issue , but this is a very important change of change , a culture of the next generation .
this project is a part of the 331 countries , and in uruguay , half the children have already got their laptop computers and all the children in uruguan will have their laptop computer .
what about the results ?
now , all the other nations have been taught to teach you that the teachers have never been so loved , and not the ability to be judged by the third-degree evaluation .
maybe the most important change is that the children began to teach their parents their parents .
they have their laptop computers , and they 're bringing it home .
and i met three kids at school , and one of the three children who came to bogotá all day , and one of the three children who came to bogotá .
the reason she came with her is because she taught six year to write to her mother 's mother .
her mother never went to elementary school .
this is a beautiful case between parents and children , and it 's a beautiful case that the children have become a change of change .
people are asking me , why is it your laptop ?
your laptop computer says that they work for their pods , but they 're not .
giving me your laptop is because of the possibility of constant education .
oyc is an educational project . it 's not your laptop .
they need education , and they can see 100 books through their laptops .
in one village , there 's a 100 laptop computers , and if each of them 's computers are stored in another hundred different books , then there are 100,000 books .
when you and i were in elementary school , we could n't have a book of £ 10,000 .
sometimes under a tree can be a school , or in a number of times , and in a number of times , you have to be a professional model for just a lot of school .
so , we give you one more time , and we 're going to take one of the program to get one .
last year , we ran one of a program , a program that was able to get a hundred , 1,000 laptop computers , and offered them to the children .
you can take this to a country where you ca n't live through a free laptop with a free laptop .
we went to the republic of haiti , and we went to the republic of haiti and afghanistan .
it 's not commercial mayor , but we are handing out enough supply of the world , the connection to the world , to take advantage of our young children .
and we can actually offer a lot of laptop computers .
think about it like this , and consider it a booster shot from the ignorance of the children .
and consider it a vaccine on your laptop .
you 're not just doing a vaccine to some kids .
the entire world will give all the children the vaccine inoculation .
well , i thought we should talk about death . "
i think it 's a passion day .
actually , i 'm not talking about death .
death is inevitable and terrifying , but what i really want to talk about today is fascinated by the legacy that i 've left behind .
that 's what i 'm trying to do .
the art of art buck has left video footage of his sense of humor , and that footage is not over until he 's dead .
and , uh , the mike i met at the ted pagos , he was left in a cyber space for his own journey through his own journey .
and my father left me with letters and notes through his handwriting .
the last two years he was sick , he filled his thoughts against me .
he had my own strengths , weaknesses , and a loving offer that quoted my life .
after he died , i realized no one else would ever write to me anymore .
the writing is disappearing . it 's not the only thing that 's ever been done .
i love the e-mail , and i 'm thinking about the staff , but why would you leave the old habit for a new habit ?
why do we have to exchange letters and emails in our lives ?
sometimes i want to trade my father 's hugs and change every single hug i 've ever talked about .
but it 's too late .
but if the paper i sent you to read and read the letters i had now , i feel that i 'm connected to him .
so , maybe we should all leave our children 's precious legacy to our children , not just the financial ones .
it 's the most valuable artifact of a human being , the book of a book , the letters that have provided for themselves .
if a fraction of this powerful audience can buy a beautiful piece of paper - john , it could be a bit of a rehab , which could cause a revolution in the west law class .
then what am i gonna leave with my son ?
i collect a book of signatures , and you know i 'm hunting them .
i have plans to publish my notes .
seeing his father 's body to swallow a fire , he wrote a paper on the side of a pile of paper .
i did n't think about how to do it , but i decided to cut my father 's mind and let me write my own book for my son .
now i 'm reading a few passages about the poetry of the poem i used when i was cremated .
all right , linguists , please forgive the grammar , because i 've never reviewed it for the past ten years .
i pulled this out of my way to the first time .
" pictures of the picture , ash in the bottle , constant energy , and force me to deal with what i 've grown up .
i hear you , i know that you want me strong , but right now , i ca n't breathe under a wave of a violent feeling , just like i taught my soul on foot .
whisper in the wing of despair , and i will lead you to your full mental river to keep me alive again .
thank you .
i 'm going to talk to you about the sequel to the opening of the uncomfortable truth .
i 'll talk to you about the uncomfortable truth , but no one 's worried about the truth that nobody wants to say .
someone has to start , and i 'm gonna tell you first .
you should be afraid to be afraid of international warming before you think about international warming .
today , i 'll tell you about the national paragum .
the use of your laptop may be dangerous in your health , even if you 're a man .
this is very important information .
for example , the use of your laptop is affected by your posture .
this is the form of a woman who 's not using your laptop , which is the posture of women that are using their laptop .
-lsb- laughs -rsb- this is a man 's nature .
and this is the natural form of a man who saw this picture , and i think i 'm here right now .
it 's a man who uses it to sit down and use the laptop , and the result will sit and sit on the feet of women more comfortable than women .
but with the computer working , the men of the computer were forced to take a natural form to secure their laptop , so the temperature between the thighs began to rise . "
this is the key to the national warming .
once again , this is something very serious .
your sperm is exposed to death .
computer scale will be extinct for extinction .
the population of the national nation with a lot of your laptop is far low than the state of the state .
international warming is fun .
-lsb- laughs -rsb- -lsb- laughs -rsb- -lsb- laughs -rsb- -lsb- laughs -rsb-
i 'm gonna tell you how to do the best way to fight this , first of all , and just try and breathe .
stay in a nice suit and be cool .
keep the right details . this is wrong .
can you give chris more time , because i have a video to show you .
thank you . this is perfect .
yesterday we 've learned about the benefits of the wi-fi , and this is another benefits .
and i 've got a lot better protecting than anything else that i 've given you for a little while , and i 'd like to thank you for a little while .
this research came from 1986 but still stands .
" the core temperatures are reflected in the scrotum , and it can take a bow down . "
i do n't know what massive english english i do , but i know the testicles .
it 's like a mass of revenge , like medicine and media .
digital ball , digital media .
and for a year ago , i knew i was owned by testicular testicles .
and this investigation continues to be the support of the united states government , and you 're doing great research for your taxes .
there 's a video of the phill and your messy armpit , your dirty armpit and your dirty armpit , and the unscrupulous design , the world will see the difference .
and your grace , as your wife , i am currently in the light with the namchils and beauty , life , and a pretty good place , right ?
this commercial was one of the most popular " b " ad on the last year .
with this , we can find out how to advertise your phillip lips , the original .
the use of the laptop is the population of overpopulation , and if every means fails , it 'll be a good plan .
if you invite me back with a ted again , why do n't we just talk about what we ca n't keep our phone in your pocket ?
and this is what a young generation is trying to do to us .
- in the world of the world , the actions do n't just work , but i 'm actually moving on to it .
-lrb- applause -rrb- it 's 4:00 a.m.

do n't you need a lady ?
in a few weeks ago , the president of the united states has complained that everyone will be able to do the best in their position to escape the inauguration escape .
but what 's specific to you ?
obama did n't want to go shopping with him , unlike the president .
" please trust your country . "
" investment , investments , and no more convincing .
instead , he 's asking us to grow up .
he has complained for the human being , as a human being .
well , technically , it 's an old word .
there 's no such thing as the board of society who 's ever been in the right society .
i do n't know what they 're talking about .
i 'll take one for you .
i 'm on my way to work with the janitor who has to be the janitor who has to be the janitor who has to be the janitor who has to be the janitor behind me .
there 's a lot of things , actually .
the point is , it 's like , you know , it 's like , you know , it 's like , you know , it 's like , you know , it 's like , you know , it 's like , you know , it 's hard to use the water , the trash , the garbage , and it 's all over the box .
there are so many kinds of these little items that are so surprised , but nothing new is new .
however , there 's a part of this list , despite the fact that there are so many items on this list , that there is no one to mention in social dimensions .
there 's no one .
the job that the people in the hospital are at the church 's wedding is going to be the same way .
-lcb- \ i1 \ ch80ffff -rcb- the very first time , the psychologist had an interview in the hospital , and i know how to think about how they think about your job , which is the first time mike was in bed . oh , my god .
lynn was talking about why he was n't there , why he did n't clean up robbie 's speech , and he was talking about the fact that he did n't clean it up every day and asked him to clean it up .
there was a story to luke twice in a coma for two years , so he did n't see him clean at his son 's room .
the technicians , nurses and hospitals who showed up to the hospital , sometimes they get lucky sometimes , because they 're too young to make people feel better .
and of course , all the pervs are n't like these .
but people who think like this , the communication between people and kindness , and empathy , and empathy is the only thing in the hospital .
but if you 're on the docket , you do n't have a word about this .
these employees have to rely on other people to consider themselves .
" we do the right thing to do the right thing . "
aristotle said , " practical deeds and skills of moral techniques . "
i know what it 's like when the caretaker has to be an exception to all the rules , and as long as we know how long it is when we have to ignore our duties .
a man of wisdom can have a chance to win the end of the room like luke cleaned two of his room .
the problem is that the real world 's problem is that it 's hard to define , and it 's hard to define it with maclock and female .
wise man like jazz music is like jazz music , and he 's got to improvise , and he 's making the right noise .
the wise man understands a moral judgment like this , so that it can lead to the right direction .
not in the direction of the others , but on the way to the others .
the last thing is , there 's one more thing , the most intelligent man in the world , and it 's made of it .
wisdom depends on experience , not just any experience .
you have time to use your service to know who you are .
you need to try something new , try new things , and learn from failure and learn from failure .
and i need to be taught from the wisdom of a wise mentor .
if you are the same person i 've described to the warden , how hard it is to make this work , and they will respond and respond .
of course , this experience is not about the experience of wiping out the garbage cans .
the experience of people who treat people .
ted has a lot of good qualities .
it 's scary .
but the good news is that you do n't have to be clever to be wise .
the bad news is that they 're not smart enough to be smart .
not only for his sake , but everyone else will be in trouble .
i believe you know that now .
i have a story to show you . let me talk to you once .
it 's about lemonade .
seven years old , son and his dad were watching the detroit tigers game on the baseball ball .
my son asked dad to buy some lemonade , and dad went to the stand to buy the lemonade .
but on that stand , there was some lemonade .
i did n't know if there was alcohol " mike 's " mike 's " mike 's . "
that 's why i gave you a son .
he called the police , but he saw the security guard , and somebody else called an ambulance and left his son and left him in the field .
there 's no alcohol in the e.r. , and he said no alcohol .
you said you 'd take your son .
but not exactly .
because i said not to be the wayne child protective center .
he 's been sent to the shelter for three days .
so , can i go home now ?
he said it was a judge , but he had a condition , and he had to sleep in a different hotel room .
two weeks later , two weeks later , the families had been rehired again .
i mean , it 's all the same as an excuse to say , agents , agents , even judges , even the judge , but the protocol is to follow . "
how the hell did this happen ?
the rule and the procedure is that simon simon told me , " but you 're a fool to think about it . "
the rules are in my way , but i sent the kid home , and i sent him home .
that makes sense .
when we ran into the problem , we 're opening two ways .
first rule of the rule .
more rules , more rules .
the second solution is the dominant .
we 're looking for a lot better .
do you have any other access to any other approach ?
this is the financial crisis , too .
control your regulators , control them , control them .
change the tyrants . change it .
but the reality of the world is that we ca n't solve the control of the regulators or the public control .
do you think you can make spontaneous action to make spontaneous behavior ?
are you gonna give me a bonus to someone else 's share of feelings ?
that 's crazy .
it 's a short time to increase the regulators and the chain of regulators , of course it 's working , but it 's gonna make it worse from a long-term perspective .
and when we start to rely on the rules , the moral judgment breaks out and we lose the opportunity to learn and learn from the situation .
it 's like an unrely inference to excessive inconsistent with the humanlessness , and that 's the only thing that 's right to do is to eliminate the motive .
no one ever intended to do that , but he 's been fighting wisdom with wisdom and the rules .
let 's say a few things , and the control and half the wisdom .
this is the first time that we 're talking about the lemonade .
the two of you are very familiar with you , it 's limited to the modern american training system and the protocol is in the middle of the frame .
i want to see the example of the chicago kindergarten .
i 'll let you know how dangerous the " b " is dangerous .
you know , i teach you about 25 pages of books , and there 's a 75 danger on the list .
every school in chicago , every teacher , the same day , the same one , the same one , the same one .
it 's almost as if you need a list .
because we do n't trust your judgment , therefore , you have no idea .
this list is an insurance policy to stop the disaster .
i mean , actually , this is a very big accident .
but in the end , the only thing that 's guaranteed is to be in the game .
i 'm not saying you do n't need the rules .
a jazz player should have had a sense of a jazz player , but it should be a sign of mark .
there 's supposed to be a rule that can control the bankers .
but we ca n't afford too much regulations , because we ca n't be able to improvise players , because we do n't have to improvise .
the results are just disappearing , and i 'm not playing with other musicians anymore .
what about the invs ?
it 's a clever way to say it .
there 's only two reasons why you 're gonna have to do something , logically , because i have two reasons to do that .
right ?
unfortunately , it 's not always that .
there 's a number of reasons why the only reason is that there 's a competition between them , instead of trying to improve each other .
we do n't have much time , so let 's just say one thing .
15 years ago , he was in switzerland , and he was deciding where he might be .
it was supposed to be a whole wide national vote .
at the time , swiss psychologist picks up some people who know what they 're capable of .
" if you say you 're going to build a nuclear waste of nuclear waste in your neighborhood , "
amazing , 50 percent say " yes . "
you know it 's dangerous .
i knew the price of the land would fall .
it should be a problem where it 's going to be , and it 's responsible for a swiss citizen .
the hearing was a little different for everyone this time .
" if you 're more than six weeks a paid salary , would you like to share a nuclear waste of nuclear waste in your village ? "
two motivations , first responsibility , and the money .
like 50 % of that " yes , " and in this case , " yes , it did n't come to 25 % . "
because the second question is that you 're in the middle of the opposition , and the question has changed , and the question is , what is my responsibility ?
" which one is the advantage . "
it 's always the same bonus when the ceo of the company is a bit of a bonus to a small bonus when the ceo of the company does n't work anymore .
we need to create a smart " the clever " system .
but the reality is this , we ca n't create a clever human being .
inverv is always going to be abused by purpose .
we need a human body . we should eat it .
but you 're relying on our job as our job , and it affects two of the best things that we work as a job .
to lower the morale of a man who does it , and the consequences are made of morality itself .
he said , " obama said before you asked for it , ' cause before you asked for it , people are more dependent on the stricts , not to ask if it 's the right thing to do .
this is already real .
well , it 's not a big deal , but , uh , we can take a look at that later .
" sorry , i 'm sorry , but you 're fired , because we need someone who does n't want to keep our competition from the competition .
what do we do ?
we have a few hopeful facts , and we have to go to work and restore ethics .
the first method of ethics .
the problem is that the problem between people and people are filled with paper , and they 're not supposed to be able to sign it , so they 're just about to get stuffed in a chain of humans .
so , what kind of options do we have ?
first of all , the good one .
if you go to law school , you tell a few people who talk about their conscience .
she does n't go to law school to learn an m.a.
people are provocation from heroes like this .
it 's not easy for people to know that if they do , it 's not easy for me to know .
but you just need to know .
i 'm proud of him that he 's around .
admit it .
i want you to know that there 's someone that tells you how to teach you .
this is what we can do .
i do n't know how many minutes of you remember this , and i had a man of the human castle 15 years ago , the ceo of paul latestein .
and then one of the three thousand employees paid me a salary .
if you did n't pay for the staff , it would have been a disaster in the neighborhood of three thousand .
" if you see in the corner of the corner , we 'll have a lot of assessment of our company 's evaluation , but i think it 's worth it . "
there was a lot of heroic heroes this time .
especially two people .
one of them is ray anderson .
because it 's the right thing to do .
he 's got more money than he expected .
the staff has a lot of provocation .
i 'm happy to do what you think you 're right about .
willie , willie , you were talking about what happened last night to rebuild the forest in indonesia .
-lrb- applause -rrb- i think it 's perfect .
he needed the right to do the right thing .
we need a lot of skills and effort if we see it on the outside .
i did n't know that willy 's team was trying to get that job , and i did n't know how much it was gonna be , and i was surprised .
as usual , the most important thing to make this work , the most important thing in the neighborhood was to know the person in town .
it would have failed without the help of a good relationship with the locals .
there are no official formula to make local people on their side because the other society has a different way of operating on each other 's lives .
there 's a lot we have to admit , not just ted here .
you do n't have to be a big prize for what you are .
just a regular hero .
just like the concierge of the hospital , ordinary heroes have to be title .
as long as we 're in life , we all have to try to be a hero , a hero in life , and be a hero .
when you 're responsible for one organization , you must try to create a sense of humanity and moral voluntarily .
no matter how wise and wise , we do n't want to have a human life and a moral compass until we get to work .
if y 'all run into the organization , do n't make anything in a position like that , and do n't make that position , you 're gonna get rid of the garbage line .
because it 's the only way you do this with someone who is not alone is to be a human moral liability in the end .
i need " practical wisdom " in all this .
as one teacher , as a teacher , we have to be a small hero in our daily lives , to make an example of the people we teach .
as a teacher , i 'd like to remember a few more things .
that we 're always teaching .
someone 's always watching us .
the cameras are always watching .
bill gates has put the importance of education , and as it is , as an example of the kremp 's example , as he says , " power is power . "
i told you about the amazing story about how kwp would send the kids to college , but i told you that i could have been going to college .
he did n't mention it , but i have one thing that i 'd like to emphasize about in the story .
the most important thing that they need to learn is that they 're going to learn the most important thing .
children must learn to respect themselves .
you must learn to honor your friend .
i need to learn how to respect you .
and above all , you need to learn how to learn .
this is the key .
the rest of this , the rest has been made out .
the way you taught the kids like this , it was your own actions , not the way you did , it was ben 's behavior .
obama has been a man of men 's virtues .
i think that 's right .
i think the most important thing in common is the practical wisdom , because it 's the practical wisdom and the courage to be fit in the end .
obama has been keen on hope .
you 're right again .
i believe there 's a reason i could have hope .
i believe people have the right to do it .
it 's like a lot of things that have been ted and a lot of things .
to do the right thing for the right reasons .
you have to listen to the mind of wisdom in our hearts .
just have to listen to what we do and how we do it , and more importantly , what we each have to do is stop it from inside our wisdom , and keep the wisdom inside us .
thank you very much .
thank you .
please , chris anderson , give me some applause .
thank you .

let 's send one of those e-mails to the sea and send it to a man who thinks it 's called " dardarly . "
ted .
last year , i told you three things .
i told the statistics of this world are n't designed to be used properly .
because of him , we still have a false opinion about the nation and the nationalists .
and i told him that the moving graphic could bring a breakthrough .
there 's a lot of things changing on the statistics of the un 's web site today that we can access every database of the un of all the database of the united nations .
i 'd like to share some of these images with a few of these images .
three things happen .
the united nations have released the statistical data , and we 've placed a new version of the software to use the new version of the software , so you do n't have to use it to download .
i 'll make sure that you 've seen what you 've seen last year .
these are the countries .
this place is a child , a female child , a child , and this is average life .
these are the 1950s , and this is the design of the state of development .
back then , there was " us and them . "
there was a big car in the world .
but the car 's changed , and it 's been a pretty good job .
i 'll see what happened right now .
the chinese is the big one , you see .
there 's a blue one over there .
i 'm just trying to show them how deeper this year is really changing .
you see , africa seems to be a little bit of trouble down here , is n't it ?
the same family system , the hiv , and the hihic of hiv is now in the area .
this is what we saw last year , and this is what 's gonna happen in the future .
but is this possible ?
i do n't even have statistics that you 're looking at .
this is our current present .
is it possible that we can do this ?
i 've had a complete conjecture on my life .
i 'm a hundred years old .
and we 're here now .
now , let 's see what the world 's economic situation is .
i 'd like to show you that the economy is based on children 's survival rate .
we 're gonna have to start the drinking .
there are four children dying there , and there are 200 children in there .
and there 's a gun production on this dance .
this is 2007 .
i 've turned past time , and i put it in the past - it 's in the past - it goes back to the past , a little more , a little more , a little more , a little more , a little more .
we still have statistics .
i 'd like to look into the food , see if you saw the 1820 and sweden , only in austria and sweden .
but these two countries are down here , and they 've produced 1,000 bucks per year .
and i lost it before the third stone of five minutes .
i 'll see how much the world has been compared to the end of the world .
the world is rich slow , and i collect the statistical data .
look , if you collect the statistics , do n't you think ?
you see the importance of the data .
you see , the children do n't live longer than i am .
the last century , it was very bad for the children of europe in the 1870s .
by the end of the 20th century , the children gave me the first stones .
it 's an indian progress , from the first data .
this is america . we make more money . more money .
you 'll see china coming up from that corner after a while .
but they 're not being rich , but they 're not going to be rich .
well , marolla is dead here , and there 's a bummer coming in here .
china is moving this way .
the circle is growing up there , and this is the image of the world today .
let 's take a look at america .
i 've got this function , and i 'm telling the world , " it 's over here . "
i only have the united states - we have to get background , and we 're gonna go back now .
if you look at america here , you can see where you are on the right right side .
america 's always on the money .
in 1915 , america was a neighbor in india , for the modern modern extradition .
that means america 's richer , but it means we lost more children than india .
look at this , compared to the philippines today .
now , the philippines have the same size of the size of the size of the size of world war ii , and it 's almost the same size .
but it 's time to invite us to the united states , and the american health level can see the same level of health level .
in 1957 , the american health level is the level of the philippines .
this is the drama of many people who call the world , asia , middle east countries , and health resources in south america .
there are other criminal record on the current development of our current development .
social benefits and social advancement are getting ahead of the economy .
in 1957 , america had the same economic level as chile .
so , how many times will we have to get the flu so fast that chile has a health level of health ?
maybe one ... 2001 , in 2002 , there 's a health level in chile .
chile 's catching up !
maybe chile has higher children 's survival rate than america in years .
it 's a big change that the difference between 30 or 40 years is a big change .
it 's based on the education level .
there must be a lot of things that have been involved with an inlade , and there 's a general resources .
i want to show you how fast the world 's change of the world 's change of the world is .
i 'll go to 1920 . see japan .
and i 'll see the swedes and the united states .
here i am , ford and i are red and red , and i 'm a race of brown , and i 'm a race of brown .
-lrb- laughing -rrb- let 's go .
as you can see , donyota is the one who 's going to derail the road .
you 're doing great .
it 's war , the donyota derayota , and now the donyota is going to be stronger than sweden .
now donyota is going to overpass the sweta , and now he 's stronger than sweden !
and then i sold the bowl , and i bought the donyota .
now , you see now , the speed of the japanese will be able to see something very quick .
he really caught up fast .
and this is 1,000 .
you can understand the first generation .
now here 's to show me the history of my family , and i 've created these readings .
the same plot , the money , the health , the health , you know ?
let me show you my family .
in sweden , my great-grandmother was born , my great-grandmother was born .
sweden was like a siera de leon now .
the year of 1863 , my great-grandmother was born .
at the time , sweden seemed like a big boy .
and in 1891 , my grandmother was born .
and now i 'm not talking about statistics , which is why i have to free my family 's history .
when grandma saw the statistical statistics , then i believed in statistics .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- i think this is the best way to test historical statistics .
sweden was like me .
it 's very strange that there 's a number of things that happen to the sahara in africa , in the vicinity of the desert .
my mother was born in egypt one more time , and i 'm ...
i 'm a mexican member of our family .
and my daughter was born in chile and my granddaughter 's girl was born in paul , and she was born in paul 's most healthy country .
after two or three years ago , he passed a sweden at children 's survival rate .
you know , sing is a very small country .
we all ca n't win the swedes that live in the woods so close .
-lrb- laughing -rrb- if you lose , sing in paul .
he 's the best paul now .
now it 's all gonna be a good story .
but it 's not simple enough to all of this .
there 's one more thing i need to show you .
now , i 'm gonna try and make it in variables . now what do i choose ?
co2 output on the population to the population .
what you 're looking at right now is in 1962 , the americans are free of 16 tons per hour .
china takes 0.6 tonnes , and india is 0.32 tonnes .
so how does it change when it 's time ?
well , rich and healthy , and all those good things that are good enough to hear of the co2 emissions .
there 's no such thing as a country that 's done without making it .
the data 's still has n't been updated yet because of the new version of the release .
now , we 're here in 2001 .
there 's a lot of people that say that a lot of people are going to attend global leaders , and the problem is , the financial community is getting too much of the carbon dioxide .
" well , you 're the one who started this problem . "
and we will forgive you for the climate . " but we forgive you .
because i did n't know .
but from now on , we 're gonna pay for the population .
from now on , we 'll be counting on the population .
everyone 's responsible for the release of the population output .
this is the data that mankind ca n't achieve good economic and healthy growth .
this is what really needs to change .
i 've been critical that you 're showing a lot of images of human beings so positive , but i do n't think it 's like this .
the world is a very powerful place .
this software is called a dollar street .
everyone lives on this road .
here 's what they live in here , the number of people living in a day .
this family is approximately one $ 1,100 a day .
i 'm going up on this road and i 'll find a family that 'll find two hundred to three times a day .
once a little more , we 'll find the first garden on this road , and they make it 50 bucks .
how do they live ?
when i look at bed here , i can see a carpet on the ground and sleep on the floor .
80 % of the family 's income is to be met with energy and food and only two of them .
this is a two-mile house , a bed , a bed .
it 's a good little bedroom that i 'd like to see .
i got this lecture at iifa , and he wants to see the couch right here .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- this is the couch couch .
and one interesting thing is , when you look around here here , you can see your family sitting on the ground .
even though the couch is on the couch , you can see that there is no difference between the women in this family .
you can see the good conditions with good conditions .
and you 're gonna have to look around the bathroom to see the big difference .
this could change , too .
all these pictures from africa could improve .
we can free the poor .
my self is not about it or anything like this .
i interviewed an african farmer at the threshold of the hunger for 20 years .
and this is the result of research for the farmers .
one good thing in this picture does n't seem to be a researcher who 's a researcher .
that 's what research is for society , when you really live with them .
everything in poverty is to survive to survive .
we can use the food to fill the food .
here , these young farmers , they 're now , and now they 're the girls , and they 're talking to them and talk to their own farming scholars .
this is one of the most skilled farming students in malawa now that he is discussing some kind of sansanbar , the sancassbar is the plant of the most distinguished sunlight that mankind has ever found .
i want to see that the farmer 's crew wants to take his advice , because we have to survive the poor .
that 's the reason why .
it 's another one of the poor .
she said , " give us the science skills .
we 're too close to this mess . it takes hours .
you can go flour and give us the rest of the time , and we 'll figure it out . "
science technology can save us from the poor , but we can escape the poor .
now this woman is very pleased to take her grain to the market .
and she 's very grateful that society is invested in education , so if we can count the numbers , we do n't have to cheat on the market .
she wants her child healthy so she can go to the market , not home .
and she wants talap . it 's a wrap road .
there are some things that can buy .
mike gave her a bike .
and when the information can tell the mayor , he can tell us what kind of stuff he wants to go to the market .
ladies and gentlemen , you can do this .
the fact that my 20 years in africa have told me that the impossible is possible .
africa never did it .
in 50 years ago , we grew up in europe with the country of europe and countries that work in the middle of the century .
i say africa is the best thing in the world to be the best in the world for the last 50 years .
because we do n't even think about where they started .
this foolish idea of our nation growing up in argentina and compared to the last 50 years of the year , we have n't done any sleep and a half .
we need to know more about this world .
one of my neighbors knows 200 wine .
there 's nothing i do n't know .
i know the grapes , and i know the temperature .
but i only have two different types of wine , red and white .
but my neighbor does only know two different countries and development of industrial nations .
i know 200 things , too .
you guys know .
but i need to be serious right now .
you have to create power points .
we pay our respects to an office package package , do n't you think ?
well , what , what , what , what , what , what , what , what , what , what , what , i 'm trying to do it now ?
all i 'm saying is that there 's a lot of stars in progress .
everybody 's got something you like .
if you 're a corporation , you like mike a credit card .
if you 're fighting for the non-government agency , you 're like a virgin equality .
or if you were , you 'd have liked the institution like o 'o .
at the level of the world , we need more than ours .
we need everything .
all of these are important to grow up , especially when they 've been out of poor poverty , they 're going to go to social services .
now , what we need to think about is what 's growing up , what the growth of growth is , and what is the tool for growth .
first of all , i will define the most important tool .
it 's the most important professor of public health professor to me , because it explains 80 % of the survival of survival .
in order to go to the office of the 1800s , that 's the 180-year kelly from disaster .
the government eventually makes the law .
the education and the enemy are important .
health health is important , but not a big tool for growth .
the environment is important .
the human rights are important , of course , but they ca n't affect their growth .
now , where are we going ?
we 're not interested in the money .
money is not the target .
the best tool , but the target will give you a zero .
well , it 's fun to vote , but it 's not a target .
going to school , that 's not a tool .
i 'm gonna give you the advantages of health health , and it 's good for you to be healthy , especially when i 'm older .
well , that 's good , but i 'll have two of you .
the environment is very , very determined .
if we do n't save them , we 'll have nothing to do with it .
but where are the important goals ?
of course , that 's human rights .
human rights are our goal , but it 's not a big tool for growth .
and the culture thinks it 's the most important of our culture because it 's making our lives happy .
that 's what life is worth .
it 's possible it 's impossible .
the people in africa can accomplish this .
i showed you the possibility that i ca n't make it possible .
and remember , please remember my most important message .
we can make a good world .
i fucked up the footage , and i proved the power point , and i 'm going to try to convince you that i 'm a cultural point .
-lrb- laughing -rrb- get my knife !
tell them to swallow the knife from the ancient india .
this culture has inspired humans to think of thousands of years .
now that i am able to prove that you 're impossible , this metal , this metal , the last one , we 're the last in the war .
it 's all inreplaceable . can you hear me ?
now i 'm going to show you that this metal blade is impossible to push into my blood and live in my flesh .
will you all be quiet ?
this is a big particle accelerator .
- he 's got to be 227 miles .
this is the biggest scientific experiment ever happened .
only physicists and engineers have come to see the world of the world , and they 've built this machine together for decades .
what we 're trying to do is accelerate the proton of the proton , so it 's closer to the 90-9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 .
at that rate , the proton is about 27 miles per second .
and we collided with the beams that are going to take them into different directions .
we 're going to collide in a giant grave pod .
the water detector works as like digital cameras .
and this is the atlas atlas i 'm working on .
you can imagine how huge this size is to look at the idea of the man down there .
and now , you know how huge it is , it 's 100 meters across the actual , uh , 35,000 tons of weight .
and we make a certain conditions , and this is where the universe began to create a shorter point of the universe , and it 's a hell of a lot more than a billion times per second .
and that metal parts of those metal parts are the largest magnet in the world to measure the speed of the particles .
this is a year ago .
those magnets are in there .
and you can figure out how big this is , so you can figure out how big this is .
and there 's a little big bang in there , like this summer .
and the fact is , i got an e-mail this morning , and we just ended up with the final parts of atlas .
so it 's coincidence that atlas ended today , and i 'll tell you the first time that it was done with ted .
-lsb- applause -rsb- how great is it ?
and yet , " why is that great ? "
why do you think the universe began to make the same conditions that the universe started ?
well , the particle physicists are dead .
the goal of a physicist 's goal is to figure out what it 's made and how they operate .
and of course , there are hundreds of billions of billions of galaxies in the milky way , and there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the milky way .
it 's all things itself .
so , why do n't you just ask me , but why ca n't you just observe ?
" if you want to know what i 've done , you 'll just observe me , right ? "
now , the universe gets hot and hot , crowded , crowded , and simple and simple and simple .
you do n't have to know this right now , but it 's true .
because the universe is beginning to be very simple and easy to understand .
it 's all complicated , for example , like human brains are old and complicated and complex , and complex and complicated .
we believe that the universe was very simple when we turned into one second of the early ten million minutes .
-lsb- dramatic music -rsb-
imagine that there 's a snow in the hands , it 's incredibly complex , but if you open it up here , it 's a very , very , beautiful object that makes it impossible .
it 's the same idea that the universe is made of time to understand what the universe is created .
today , the universe is made of these things .
it 's just 12 particles , combined with the four power of nature .
quq , this pink object creates a neutron and a neutron nuclear reactor , and we 're building a nuclear nuclear reactor .
the electron , which means that the surrounding nuclear nuclear reactor is contained by the power of the radiation , and this radiation is contained by the raditic force .
the krauts are through each other through the particle accelerator .
and this is called weak force , which must have been the first time i heard .
but without them , the sun is not shining .
when the sun is shining , it 's called a great amount of new triano .
in fact , when you look at your thumb and your thumb nails , it 's like a second billion centimeters per square , and that 's the size of 600 billion feet per square .
but you ca n't feel them because they 're weak because their power is weak .
these particles were found in a century ago .
first one was found in 1897 , and the last one was found in 2000 , and the last one was found in 2000 , right ?
on the road .
if you compare it to the universe , america is just one thing .
and now , this is found in 2000 , which is why this painting is unique .
i 'd be surprised how small this is about what i found .
as you guys know , it 's very small to be the size of the universe as the size of the universe .
i mean , it 's the size of a thousand billion galaxies , 1,1337 billion light-years away , and the size of the galaxy is actually roughly the size of a mongirey .
clearly , we have discovered sophisticated and elaborate of the particles .
and so , my esteemed esteemed university of manmanford university , who found this man , ernst uvanford , who discovered the physics of physics , is physics or stamps . "
i do n't think he 's an offense to other science industry , although he 's from new zealand , maybe not .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- but what he said , is what we 've been doing , really , it 's kind of like collecting stamps .
now , we have discovered the particles , but you are a hiding pattern , so you really do n't really know what it is that you do n't understand .
fortunately , we are the largest scientific performance in the 20th century .
it 's the law of newton 's law , if you need to wear physics .
it 's called " standardize - beautiful math formula . "
you can say that you 're a symbol of the t-virus on your t-shirt .
this is it .
i 'm a little bit overboard because i 've had this formula very specific .
yet , despite all these formulation that allows you to calculate the math , everything that happens to the universe .
so if you want to know why the dna has been so blue , if you want to know why the dna looks like it .
most of the time , we can figure out how to calculate this official .
but there 's a problem here .
do you know what that is ?
anyone can understand .
i really need to make this easier , zoom in on one lines .
usually , these parts mean something .
that 's why the " wa " is called " w. " and explain how to stick together .
same as " zwett , " too , as well as " zwett . "
but there 's a combination of " h. h. "
yeah , " h . "
" h " means the higgs .
the higgs particle has n't been found yet .
but , you know , the higgs , it needs to be on the math formula .
and that 's impossible for us to do everything that we can do with all the clarity we can do with that great formula .
that 's why we 're going to have a new particle .
so what do you think this is ?
now , i 'm going to have to talk to you about a long time ago .
in the 1980s , we 've been asking the british government to volunteer to build a lhc , if you can explain what the politicians are doing .
i want to know what the higgs is . "
we 've been thinking of a good metaphor , and this has been working .
now , the higgs is what the higgs does , which is a mass of the basics .
try to build the whole universe , including the inside of your own , the whole universe is filled with the higgs , which is filled with the higgs .
i mean , the higgs .
people think they 're higgs , and they think they 're higgs .
now , the particle accelerator will interact with the universe and the higgs .
but think about it , someone who 's not really famous when you pass through the room .
so they ignore this room so quickly , they can pass the room so quickly , they do n't have a mass .
and imagine someone 's very important and famous and smart .
they have been mixed around by people , and the path they 're passing through .
it 's like they 're heavy , they have a mass .
and that 's how the higgs is working .
this painting is in the body , and there 's a mass in your body , and there 's a mass of those things around us , because these are n't the higgs , because these are all the higgs .
they 're working with the higgs .
if this is true , we have to find the higgs particle .
if it 's not true , this mass mass is pretty complicated because the higgs is the simplest way we can figure out what the higgs does .
and that 's the first reason we should be building this giant machine .
well , i 'm glad you recognize the marksmanship thatcher .
actually , i was trying to make this more convincing , but ...
that 's why .
guarantee that the lhc will find out what the lhc is going to find .
there are other kinds of problems in particle physics , as you came in .
one of them is the dark matter , dark energy .
there 's another issue here , actually , but the power of nature is quite beautiful , as it turns into the past .
that 's why the power of the power changes .
therefore , the effects of the energy that ties our bodies into one atomic temperature is powerful and more powerful .
powerful strength , which means the strong nuclear power to tie down the nuclear reactor , and you see the basic model of the world that you can calculate this is almost one of the three power of power .
just like one second powerful power , when the time starts .
but it wo n't be long .
it 's called supersymmetry , double the standard model of particle model , which does n't seem very simple at all .
but , in fact , through this theory , we knew that the power of nature was being unified by one big , predictable , unpredictable model .
and these supersymmetry particles are very powerful dark matter .
so this is a very forward theory and it 's actual physics .
and if i make money , i 'm a very , very scientific solution , and all these supersymmetry particles will catch up to the lhc .
the lhc is able to find a way to find out .
but for the last few minutes , i 'd like to show you what i think of the universe and the universe , which is real physics .
particle physics is to remind us that the great kind of beauty , the universe , the creation of the universe , the creation of the universe , it 's been spent decades since the study of modern science .
and i think this is worth it , based on wade davis ' mind based on the high andes in high andes , at least the story of creation and frozen north .
i think it 's a miracle that i think it 's a miracle .
we know that this winning universe is a lot smaller than 137 billion years ago , and it 's been a lot smaller than one atom , which is much smaller than one atom .
the universe began to grow up , but if i was right after the big bang , the universe was right after the big bang .
gravity has been separated from the other forces .
the universe began with a series exponential expansion .
it creates hundreds of hundreds of millions of people , and it creates the higgs , and the people and the electrons are going to make it a mass .
the universe gets colder .
after the drugs past , hydrogen and helium view the universe , that 's all it is .
the 75 % of the universe is hydrogen , and 25 percent are helium .
the universe is constant , for three billion years .
and then the light started running around the universe .
because the universe has grown enough to be invisible , and that 's why we call it a new copy of the universe , and it 's called the face of the universe .
in about four billion years later , the first stars were born , and the hydrogen elements started to put a little bit more powerful .
and so the elements of our lives have been created in this very first generation - carbon and oxygen , and all the elements of the stars are destroyed , and we 're going to explode .
the elements are reproducing other stars and planets again .
and then some of these planets have created a hydrogen and a fusion which creates hydrogen and fusion , and the water flows through water .
at least one of these planets has evolved in one planet , and the early life is to evolve over two millions of millions of years ago in the mud field .
in the light of the darkness , we were able to look into civilization in the universe .
one of my great heroes ... said , " this is it , and it 's not just the only thing , and these are the ones who are coming from a hydrogen v 's dna , and literature , and literature , and literature , and literature . hydrogen atom .
this is really amazing .
it 's the law of physics , is n't it ?
so , the laws of the right side are built in beautiful balance .
if it was a little different , it would n't have been stable , and carbon would n't be stable , and the universe was in the heart of the star , and there was nothing in the universe that could exist .
and i do , actually , i think it 's amazing and cool .
50 years ago , i could n't tell you that because i did n't know .
it makes me feel like this , if you believe in these cultures , if you believe in this scientific creation , it would be a big deal for me .
now , the lhc .
when the lhc moves in summer , the lhc will use the new pages of the book .
and i 'm still waiting for the lhc and the lhc .
thank you .
do you have any pictures of alfred chaturvedi ?
was anyone afraid of that movie ?
you can go outside now .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- this is a raven vending machine .
the last few days , you asked me like this , " why did you start doing this ? "
i started thinking about this amazing cocktail party , and i just started thinking about it .
ten years ago , friends with a cocktail party , a bunch of guys coming home to make them grow up and making them dirty and they 're making them dirty .
these are filthy beasts .
i had to kill her to kill her .
i told him i 'd be a fool to train him to do something useful .
my friend said it was impossible .
you know the amazing thing that someone is saying is impossible , and you know that .
so i read the book about the crows for ten years .
after ten years , my wife finally said , " do n't you want to make the vending machine ? "
that 's why i made it .
because one reason i 've been interested in the crows is that no one has been paying attention to survive in spite of a man 's compound in a black market .
especially the most popular species we can see around the world , the ones who adapt to the human world , the roaches , the monkeys , the crows .
we 're looking at these people , and we 're going to live in our lives .
i was mostly used to being perfect .
in return , we only tried to kill them .
that 's why they were n't allowed to move in on a one-sided basis .
we had to find a new life to survive , to survive with us .
that 's the meaning of a rat or a cockroach .
you know , the people who tried to kill cockroach , they know that it 's gonna be a great immunity for the thrushes , but it 's gonna be the biggest immunity we can use .
that 's why i wanted to build a relationship for mutual interests .
we need to find a way to make a new relationship to each other .
that 's why we made this machine .
but if you know about the crow , this machine is more interesting about this machine .
turns out the raven is not only adapting in the human environment .
home on earth , except part of the arctic and south of south america .
it was only hard to find them out of a mile away from the human residence .
even if we care whether we care whether we do n't care , they live around us all the time .
i 'm not surprised , but more than half of the population is living in the city ,
the entire population has 90 % of its growth .
the raven around us is a multitude of crows .
birds are exponential .
that 's why i see a lot of them .
it 's more interesting to me that this is a unique adjustment for a raven .
i 'll take one for you .
this is betty , a newleleia raven .
when this crow catches a bug in the wild , we use a branch .
take a look at how you 're pulling meat out of this tube .
but the problem begins here .
someone has left a piece of wire to make a piece of wire .
betty has never done this before with wire .
look , it 's not working .
but i 've adjusted right now .
i 've never seen anything like this before .
i 've never learned to be able to bend wire into the shape of the wire .
but you did it yourself .
please remember i 've never seen anything like this .
this is it .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's it .
i was right in the middle of the workshop .
the more we study , the more they knew the crows were very smart .
the crow 's brains are balanced like chimpanchics .
there are multiple kinds of stories about the crow 's intelligence .
for one instance , swedish crows waited until the fishing boat stopped drawing the fish to the fishing line .
when the fisherman cleared out of the room , he flew and flew , and they said they 'd eat fish or bait .
to the fisherman is a very annoying man .
i 've been at the university of washington for many years , and there was a team where i grabbed a few of my experiments , and i had a team to do it .
some student grabbed a couple of crows with a couple of crows , and then they took the weight and the size of it again .
and the interesting thing that 's ever found is that the raven has been around and annoying and annoying all over the week .
and then in the next week , it was n't funny anymore .
but the crows will be the next month and the summer break is over .
i remembered the students , until i left school with graduation , even after graduation .
the lesson of this case is not to mess with the crows .
so students who study in washington is a big wig and a big mask .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- very interesting .
now , it 's clear that the crows are smart , but the more we study , the more powerful their enemy is .
the crows are new in new york 's most effective forces in the history of the new york environment .
the raven in japan has developed a new food law to drop hard nuts on the back of the road .
now , the problem is the way the shell comes from not being hit by a car .
wait till the vehicle is on fire .
and it makes us safe .
-lsb- laughter -rsb- joshua cline .
it 's not important that you do n't use a car and forget your nuts .
actually , it 's a skill that 's like this to the crows .
it was at the university of tokyo school 10 years ago .
and ever since then , every raven has learned how to behave .
these days , every raven in the area is waiting for lunch in front of a crosswalk .
they 've proven the fact that they 're learning each other 's behavior .
it looks like the parents are teaching their children .
learn from friends , enemies from their enemies .
if there 's any time , i 'll tell you stories about the crows having an affair .
the point is that the crows began to reach their cultural enemy .
like you heard yesterday , we started the box of pandora 's box of pandora .
the raven is very quick and flexible to make new matters in the environment , and the enemy is very helpful in the city 's life .
there 's a lot of rumors that there 's a lot of crows .
and we know that they are smart enough to learn how smart they are .
i just realized that i 'm about to make the vending machine now .
that 's why i made it .
this is the crow 's vending machine .
it 's a device that 's trained to take the four stages of skinner 's behavior theory .
it 's very simple .
like a field , a raven set up a lot of vending machine , with coins and peanut butter around the floor .
and then the crows come up and eat the vending machine , and they get used to it .
eventually , he eats all the peanuts .
after that , he found a peanut butter on a plate , and then he ran and ran .
when the crows leave , the vending machine throws another coin and peanuts .
i can always come back and eat the peanuts .
when the raven gets used to this place , we move on to phase two .
with a raven who 's been used to the vending button and eat peanuts between the vending coin noise .
it 's gonna make it hard to eat a second step when you get used to the second level .
it 's a third step without giving the coin out .
the crows will have heat , like the good ones .
now , of course , i 'm beginning to start looking behind the ground .
one coin fell into an raid , and the peanuts came off .
it 's been a while since he 's been hanging out like this .
we learn the crows to learn how to wait around , waiting for coins , put coins in the front entrance .
when the crows come to this stage , it wo n't happen .
the crows appear to be in this stage with other animals .
like a chipmunk , they show up and they 're just gonna go looking for the peanuts .
we 'll come back and find him and go again .
if you get sick of this again , you 're gonna go out and play the road .
on the other hand , the ravens show up and try to solve the problem .
the crows realize the vending machine is just messing with the vending machine .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- they realize they need something more .
let 's poke it , try to take a little while and move on to a different way .
i can finally think of a coin on the ground , and then we 'll come and bite the coins and drop the coin at the front door .
the competition between the crows begins .
at first , the crows figured out their peanuts , but the other crows learn how to do it .
it does n't matter that the raven can train us to pick up the peanuts .
every year , a raven can not expect $ 600 million , $ 600 million , $ 600 million .
i think we should consider it a little bigger than that .
i think i can train the crows to do something else .
why do n't we train the trash to collect the trash at the end of the game ?
why do n't we just try to find a lot of expensive equipment from an abandoned electronic product ?
or maybe we find a distress and rescue people .
the biggest challenge that this experiment can throw me is that the humans and the crow can find a way to look at each other .
we can find a way to find a way to coexist with other species , to find out how to exterminate them without destroying them .
thank you .
there was a fire on 9 days ago .
the film of mine , 16 milligrams of film , all the books , my father 's books , the books , and the father 's books .
i 've been together - i was a collector , an ambitious and ambitious one .
it 's all gone .
i was just looking at the crime , and i did n't know what to do .
was this - my ... my stuff ?
i 'm always living in reality - i 'm in love .
i 'm always living with the future .
and i 've learned something strange since i was a kid , to say something good .
you have to find a good if you can go through bad things .
but this happened to me , it was really hard , and it was a very difficult time for me to cough .
that was my camera lens , and it was the first - it was the first time - 35 years ago , i was shooting around bob dillon 's movie .
that 's a film of gold , and it was the first time i had one , the only thing that was in the 1970s in the 1970s , the only one that i had was the first one i had .
that 's newspapers .
it was so fast , it was less than 20 minutes .
it reminds me of something in the moment .
" if there was bad things , i 'd have to find a good if my friends , my neighbors , my sister , my sister , my sister .
by the way , that was " sek " last year .
" putnik " was an interactive film .
this is going to be a part of me that i used to be using my own masok special , which is going to be in new york in two weeks .
i called my sister and the neighbors , and i said " parbo . "
it 's me , in front of the desk .
it was a desk of 40 years old .
you know , it 's all about it .
my daughter , jean .
my daughter is here to work with a nurse in san francisco .
" dig out , " or a piece of pieces .
i 'd like to say , " it 's a piece of piece . "
i 've been thinking about this idea that i started working with a piece of it .
it 's my sister , and he took the photos because i was the collector 's picture .
there are pictures of these ... .. what 's left of these photographs .
i did n't know - i just wanted to say , " wow , it 's a lot nicer proposal . "
that was the only copy .
i was thinking about girls .
but i said , " hey , this is really too much . "
i do n't know if you cried , but i did n't cry .
instead , i say , " i 'll get something , and i am proud of this moment , and i 'm proud of this moment , and i 'm proud of myself , and i 'm proud of myself , even if i 'm in this stage , in all these pieces .
this is arthur lee hezig 's original picture .
i was a huge record collector , and the records were gone , which i would say to you , of course it 's a tower .
it means that it was a film that was n't in fire . it means it was a film that was n't in fire .
the right film is gone .
this is the letter of my father to marry her when i was 20 years old .
that 's me and my daughter .
my daughter is still there , and this morning , he 's been here this morning .
that 's my house .
the family is staying at the hilton hotel at san diego .
my wife , hemedi , was n't as hard as i thought it was .
kids , henry and henry .
son of a son from the hotel two days ago .
all i 'm saying to you is that i thank you for the three minutes that i 've had to share with you this experience , and i 'm gonna be back again .
i 'm here to live , i live .
i saw santa crush at the house of belbny doz , which is just a mile away from here .
thank you , gentlemen .
i had to receive a media education as chairman of the united states association , and i had a meeting with cnn , and that 's the last reason i had to be optimistic about it .
the tardis 's covers at us , and i 'm going to tell us why .
cnn visit me , professor selselman , would you please tell me what happened today ?
i 'd like to interview him , " so i said , " good . "
and she says , " this is cnn . "
so i answered , " yes , how many words can i say ? "
she says , " one word . "
and then the camera went back , and she said , " what 's this thing today ? "
" excellent . "
" cut , cut , " not this .
i think it 's better if you tell me a little bit . "
" so how many words do you want to go this time ? "
dr selselman , how is this psychology 's psychology ?
" it 's not great . "
" hey , dr selselman , i do n't think this media is very comfortable .
i 'd like to give you a summary for sure .
three words this time .
professor selselman , how is your psychology on this day ?
" it 's not very good . " this is the subject i 'm trying to tell you .
i want to tell you why psychology was great , and why was n't that great , and i 'd like to tell you how great it would be for the rest of the next ten years .
at the same time , i 'd like to say the same thing about technology or design , because this issue is very similar .
so why was psychology such a good psychology ?
for 60 years , a psychology psychology was a part of the disease model .
ten years ago , when i was on the plane , i introduced myself to the person i was doing , and i told him what i did .
they made the reason why , psychology , that psychology is a problem with people and a lunatic .
but right now , when i tell you what i do , people approaches me .
and psychology , the results of psychological research , the disease , the disease model , is about 300 billion cases that you know that psychological models have n't been treated since 60 years ago .
there are 14 treatments right now that the two of them may be cured .
and another outcome is scientifically developed by mental illness .
we 've been able to measure a strict concept of depression and alcoholism .
we were able to create a mental illness .
and i can understand the condition of mental illness .
i 've been able to study the same person for a long case of schizo and a vulnerability , and i can find the number three things that are genetic and genetic activity .
for the past 50 years , we 've developed drugs and psychological therapy for the past 50 years .
we 've been able to test them with the random , random drug design , to keep the research on the research , and keep it working , and it 's not working .
eventually , psychological medicine , psychological medicine , can be able to claim that they can make the most unhappy people less unhappy in the past 60 years .
this is a great job , and i 'm very proud of you .
there are three of the negative things that have happened .
we believe that the psychologist and psychologists have become a pathologist and became pathologist when we understand the human nature .
they were forgetting that the choices were made and making choices .
this was the first price .
the second price is that we forget about ourselves .
we were forgetting a normal life in a normal life .
i 've seen people who are more than happy , and they 've been able to accomplish more and accomplish more , and they 've forgotten to be able to do their own talent or something .
no one has studied that area .
and the third problem with the disease models is to do something rush to do something to make people happy , which is not at all .
that 's why it was n't great .
and this one thing , mr. dvette , dan gilbert , mike rule , is a rule for people like me that have three goals , and there are three goals .
first psychology , the only thing that matters is to be a weakness for weaknesses , as much as it takes .
we need to be interested in taking care of as much attention as they care about the healing healing .
you need to focus on what 's best in life .
i 'm interested in giving an extraordinary skill to achieve a normal human life and an extraordinary skill .
so for the last ten years , we 've been watching the course of the future , and we 've been watching the launch of positive science science , which makes us living in life .
it turns out that there 's a lot of happiness to measure in many ways .
whoever you are , free visits to that website , every happy happy test .
how can i measure positive feelings , meaning , or the same thing to measure tens of thousands of other people ?
we 've created a mental diagnostic protocol , and we are categorized against the spirituality and the virtue of how to diagnose , how to diagnose , how to diagnose , how to get to it .
the relationship between the brain was the cause of a cautionary cause of happiness , and the relationship of the right side of the right hemisphere is the cause of happiness .
i 've been studying people in pain for the rest of my life , and they threw these questions , and how are they not ?
i started studying for someone who was very happily happily ever after six years ago .
how they talk about the rest of us .
and then there 's one other thing .
they 're not religious , and there 's no better shape , not even more , not even more or worse .
the only difference is they 're very social .
i 'm not sitting here at the seminar on saturday morning .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- they do n't spend the time alone .
everyone has a romantic relationship , and there are so many types of friends .
but this is just a relationship that 's not a causasal relationship , and it 's the first thing that 's not a relationship with hollywood , and it 's the first time i 'm gonna tell you about the happiness of hollywood .
those things are n't enough for a moment .
we were able to start investigating the investigation about what happened in the last century , with tony robbins .
the way you say you 're happy to be happy is 120 .
then we know that many of them can make a lot of things , and , actually , it 's actually randomly random and effective on the efficiency and effects of the effects .
which means that things continue to make it more happy .
for a few minutes , i 'd like to tell you some of these results .
however , the conclusion of this is the mission for psychological disease , with psychological illness , and the mission to make the most unhappy people actually make people happier ?
to ask this question is not the word i 'm good - we should have shared that question about happy .
i believe that there 's three different spots that are different because they say it 's different to say it 's different , which is why it 's possible to have three different lives than anything else .
the first happy life is a pleasant life .
a life of positive feelings , and the ability to amplify this .
number two is a life of life , working , loving , love , and your time stops when you enjoy your leisure .
it 's what aristotle was talking about .
and for the third time , it 's a life .
then i 'll tell you what you know about each and every one of these lives , and i 'll tell you what you know about this .
the first life is a pleasant life , as long as it 's best to be able to acquire a simple emotion , as long as it 's worth the taste of positive feelings and joy and joy .
there are three kinds of quirky lives in that happy life , and this is not a positive psychology , which is why we do n't stay in high school .
the first weakness is a fun life and positive emotional experience that 's genetic , which is genetic , which does n't change the fact that the 50 % is genetic .
that 's why matthew and i , and the various things that increase the positive feelings in their lives in their lives are 15 % .
second positive emotion is getting used to it , and it gets really fast .
it 's like a french vanilla ice cream , the first taste , but the taste of the sixth taste is the taste of it .
like i told you , it 's not possible .
now let 's talk about life two .
i 'd like to tell you about my friend wren , why the positive psychological psychology is more than positive feelings and joy .
len was a big success , and len was a big success .
when she was 20 , he was an option .
he was a billionaire in the chosen company , the chief of options .
he 's the second game champ . he 's a national bridge champion .
but len , in the stage of the third life , len was a terrible failure .
because he was a cold man .
-lrb- laughs -rrb- len is a bit of a sign .
when len was dating , the american women said this , you 're not funny , you 're not .
now , len was rich enough to find a mental analyst at park avenue , which was very focused on whether len kept the positive feelings in his mind .
but it turns out there is no sexual trauma in the end .
it was discovered that len was going to live in long island and he played football , and he was playing football games , and len was the one who liked it in bridge 5 % .
well , i 'd like to say , not len .
he thinks he 's one of the most happiest men in psychology .
he does n't roll hell in hell because len is very skilled in your mind .
when he walked into the u.s. stock exchange at 9:30 , it stops for him until the deadline is closed .
time to stop , when the tournament comes out of the tournament , it stops until 10 days after the tournament is over .
this is mike dec , and this is the difference between the excitement and the most important side of the side and the most important side of the world .
joy is raw , and i know how it feels , and i know how it feels .
but i ca n't feel anything else when mike 's listening yesterday .
you 're gonna be one of the music , and time stops .
you will focus on the altitude .
and this is a true nature that we think this is a great life .
i have a secret here , and you know exactly what your biggest strengths are .
one more thing , there 's an effective test to give you five strengths .
i want you to use these and make your life again .
make your job and your love again , make your love , friendship , friendship , and make it again .
i 've got a friend who worked for my peers in the cafeteria .
i hated that job .
she 's been working all the time in college .
her biggest strengths were a social intelligence , and she decided to bring things back to the most exciting thing in the day .
now she must have failed .
but what she did was cut his own head , and then we could get her back to work , and we could build as much as we could .
it 's not smile to get through it .
you did n't look like debbie reynolds .
it 's not too much .
the first road is a positive emotion .
the second road is a happy thing .
and the third path is mean .
it 's traditional to me . it 's the most agonous happiness ever .
in this perspective , it 's very similar to happiness , which means it 's much bigger than all of you , which is what it is .
one life i mentioned , happy life , a good life , a life , a life , a life , and the people that are trying to change this life .
the answer is , i 'm afraid i 'll tell you a few cases .
it 's going to be a strict method .
the same way to measure the effects of the drug .
we allocated it at random , and we put on a good dose of medicine , and we 've been doing a long-term research study in ways of different ways .
i 'd like to introduce some of the remaining interference , when we taught people our best lives , the way we taught people to have more fun in life , and they build a beautiful day and design the most beautiful day in life .
next saturday , you have to design a beautiful day for yourself , and you can use your glides and care of the joy .
we can show you how much fun we can have on the way of a happy life .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
close your eyes .
think about someone very important in your life , who changed your life into a good way , who did n't deserve the gratitude of your appreciation .
he needs to stay alive .
now , gentlemen , open your eyes .
i want you all to have a man like that .
when you learn to visit your visit , he 's using 300 words for him to call him in phoenix .
what we found is , a week later , a month later , three months later , we tested them for three months .
we 're looking for each other 's strengths , and we can design each other 's strengths and design the evening of each other .
it 's a fun boy .
but it 's very inspiring to be part of this group , so many people turned their way into charity action .
but my students and my colleagues have n't found these guys , so people do what they actually do , so they do something interesting and compared to this .
what 's interesting is that when we figure out what 's funny , this is the neanderthals .
if you do a charity to help someone else , it will last and last .
these are the conditions of positive involvement .
the last thing we want to say is we 're interested in how people are happy .
this is about the rest of you , which is our target parameters .
we ask you how to be satisfied with the functions of three different lives .
we 've been testing thousands of thousands of men over and over and over , in the pursuit of pleasure , and the pursuit of time for you , in the pursuit of the pursuit of life , in the pursuit of the pursuit of life , the pursuit of time , the pursuit of the pursuit of life .
we 're surprised that we were surprised , but there are things to be against .
the pursuit of pleasure has become almost as much as it can not be seen in life .
the pursuit of meaning is the most powerful thing .
the pursuit of the following is very powerful .
when it 's a pleasure , it 's time for you to be able to get involved with joy and the love of joy and cherry .
it 's time for life , it 's when you have all three of these three , it 's a lot bigger than each one .
on the other hand , without the three of these three things , they are more less than each one .
and what you 're asking now is the same relationship as the health rate of the body and the death rate of the body .
it 's a corporation that production is positive and involved , and what does it mean ?
healthy health , joy , joy , and is the meaning of life ?
there 's a reason why you say " two questions . "
chris told me that he had a chance to integrate the lecture , which is great , and i 've never come to this meeting .
i 've never seen a lot of fakers go through so much , and it was one of the greatest things that i could ever imagine .
but i think it 's similar to psychology , for the same reason the problems of psychological problems are based on technology , and it 's similar to the matter of design .
we all know that technology , entertainment and design were used to be used for the destructive purpose of the destruction .
we also know that technology , entertainment and design can be used to less pain .
but it 's very important to know what to do with the pain and the happiness of the pain .
30 years ago , when i first became a therapist , i was a good cook , and i thought it would be happy to stop someone , and do n't worry .
i could n't make it happy .
but it was empty .
eventually , i realized that the skills of happiness , the skill of a good life , technology is not the same .
it 's similar to this technique , technology , and design , and i believe in design .
it 's possible that the three power of the world can improve the happiness and the positive emotion , and it 's been used to it .
but if you see as happy as i do , it 's not just a positive emotion - it 's not just a good - it 's a life .
he 's designed to tell us that there 's a chance that we can create a part of the entertainment and technology that means to improve a life of life .
so the conclusion of optimism is that the only reason we are with the space elevator , the use of the space elevator , the entertainment and design of the planet .
and for 20 years , the next ten years , the technology will be great if the technology is able to improve a life that has a great life .
if entertainment makes a positive emotion , it would be great enough to switch to happiness .
and if the design can give the positive feelings , the happiness , the love , the meaning of everything we 're together is gonna be great .
-lrb- applause -rrb- that 's very important of a humanitarian incident .
i think it 's an economic point for the world population to prevent the population of 50 percent of the world like this .
paris and london and new york were the biggest cities in the world .
but what the growth of the city is over now .
the statistics are telling the obvious facts .
the population of the world has a convoy of movement from a plain rock .
why ?
the poor truth has been talking since the renaissance , and people are going to travel into a city like this , but most people are going to travel to the city .
these people ca n't seem to be very poor people .
they are people that are able to escape from poverty as soon as possible .
they are building this place directly , and if a lot of them are building themselves , they are the city plans .
they own a city of a city infrastructure that built a live urban facility .
it 's happening in mumbai in the indian gdp .
these government renovating the city 's environment , some government support these people .
education is important to the city .
what 's going on in mumbai from the streets of mumbai ?
all activity , all activity .
there 's no place for illegal residents to work , everybody 's working .
the population 's been focused on it , and it keeps up , and it keeps growing up .
the city is dealing with the explosion of the explosion .
and here 's the second point here .
we 'll have a bigger picture of the city .
the stars have come to me for a billion years of creatures on earth .
now we 're talking about the stars .
thank you .
these rocks have been struck earth for three billion years , that 's what we have to do with a lot of things that have happened on our planet .
this is a real meteorite sample , and you can see how much the iron has melted from the speed and the heat of the earth when the asteroid hits the surface .
we 're right here with the original gamnivik niwernick from the universe .
this is one of the seven poposts who did n't put a shot into the universe .
it 's not a clone .
that 's what the universe looks like in october .
without the flag of the flag , it would n't be fun to talk about the cosmic age , which would n't be interesting to mention the apollo 11 , which turned back to the moon and return to the moon .
the astronauts have taken their own red flag in each other 's own gear .
they used to bring it back in .
this was really the moon , and it brought it back .
it was for fun .
the book of books , of course , is important .
it would n't be fun to tell you about the love of the book of a book without a bible copy of the book .
you can see how hard it is to carry kumin ververbert with a bible in 1455 .
but it 's not interesting about the origins of his bible and this technology .
as you can see , the book is not designed to read .
1455 , no one could read anyone .
but why would he succeed ?
this is the original pages of the bible .
you 're looking at the number 550 years before the first printing man 's history in the history of a single printing .
we live here so that this place is in a terminal , and we live in the middle of a book , and we live in the middle of a book .
let me give you a brief story .
in the 140s , the catholics learned that the catholics needed money , so they printed out their sins , they used their own hands on paper .
they 've sold thousands of thousands of years to travel all over europe .
the sins of the guilty are trying to rescue people in purgatory .
when the labor was invented , they figured out that they could print their sins , that it was printing the money .
so , every nation in west europe has begun to buy a human being at 1455 , and then tens of thousands of copies of the population from purgatory , and that 's where you 're going to be rescued from purgatory .
that 's why martin luthor was successful because he was n't able to make it to the door , because he was printed on all the damage in the middle of western europe and every town .
ladies and gentlemen , the lieutenant of the lieutenant , the lieutenant of the united states , has nothing to do with reading , nothing has nothing to read .
i have a picture of the future library that you asked for for me , for the sake of the rest of you .
we 'll show you a little tomorrow .
instead , i 'm going to do something special for the first time in exchange for an object of speech .
we 're gonna tell you the truth , and we 're gonna show you what looks like the library , okay ?
i married the greatest woman in the world .
you know , after a while , when i went to meet eileen , this was exactly what i wanted to build .
it 's a human imagination .
indoors is above the top floor .
for 5,000 years of human imagination , it 's adjusted by a glass of glass , which leads to the computer .
it 's a movie theater , that 's the color of color .
the entire library has different things , and space is different .
this was designed like an original printing worker .
it 's part of the library downstairs , where the water changes all the time .
you can walk through the water and pass it .
you can see exactly this type of icollests in that space .
that 's my saturn planet .
you have to keep it all , you know , you guys can see this place down here in the library and things .
there are things like this in the glass , and there are things like history .
there 's a glass leg over there . it 's hanging in the space .
a leap of imagination .
so how do we create it ?
the question that i 've done , the question that we 're working on , is that we are building our own people , and in history , in history , we have a map of space , and we have a map of space , and we have a map of space , and we have a map of space , and we have a map of space . it 's a provocation of the hallway .
tomorrow , i 'd like to show you a couple or two things i 've been paying you , but today i wanted to say thank you for all the people that i told you about the library .
eileen and i are thrilled about opening our house , and we want to share it with ted family .
a hand is about a pattern in a crowd .
this is about connected to the connection .
it 's the kind of thing that i see before , which is what everyone saw before that , but it 's the way someone thought it was before .
and that 's the whole thing about discovery and imagination .
for example , we can see the dna particle .
none of us have seen it yet , but we know why it exists .
we can see the riddle of a riddle , which is from the reich party of world war ii .
now , all you have to do is tell me that this is the subject .
yeah , it 's a code for life , and it 's for death .
these two little particles are coded and antidote .
but , you guys see them , you only see the machine and a particle accelerator .
but once you 're looking at them in a new way , you realize that these two things are connected .
they 're mostly connected to this .
look , this is human brain , okay ?
it 's not uncommon , we do n't actually see the brain .
what we 're seeing is a skull , but there 's a brain there .
everything we think , we 're feeling late , and the only thing we 're thinking is that it appears to be human brains .
if we can create a new pattern in this brain , if we make this brain in the shape of this brain , it 's never going back to its original form .
i 'll give you a short sample .
we think about the internet , we think about the source of the internet .
we do n't really think about the connection to hide .
but i brought this coal , one mass of coal ,
what does the coal have to do with the internet ?
look , the internet runs the energy of a mass of coal to transmit information through the net .
every time you download one file , each megacast is a massive coal mass .
so , what does it mean , 200 megales files with this , ladies and gentlemen ?
next time , you 're gonna be one of us , and when you download into two or two or two or two , that 's not free , okay ?
the access link is to activate the web , and the energy that we think we can think of is the link to everything we can think of .
thank you , chris .
two years ago , the slide shows showed me a couple of 2000 times .
i 'm trying to show you a little slide show this morning , so i do n't need it , and i 'm just trying to lower that expectations , and i do n't need it .
because somehow , somehow somehow i was trying to handle this challenge .
but karen armstrong remembered a wonderful presentation , and if you truly understand religion , religion is not about faith .
maybe we should talk about optimism .
how dare you think we can be optimistic ?
optimism can be defined by faith or enemies .
mahatsgandhi has said a very famous word , if the world wants to change , if you want to change it , you have to be .
faith will lead a new act for me , but only to believe it is not simply to believe that the consequences are true , and i think it 's not true .
i like to change the lightbulb , and it 's good to buy the hybrid product , tipper and i , and everything else , and i 've done everything else .
but it 's much more important than changing the lightbulb .
in order to change things , sometimes we forget about citizens or democracy , we have to be very active as a citizen of democracy .
to overcome the climate crisis , we have to deal with democracy problems in crisis .
and we have a problem to solve .
i wanted to tell you something i wanted to hear .
i 've been remembered about a woman recently , and he just walked by by the table that i was sitting at , and he was just staring at me , and now she 's staring at me , and this time , she 's staring at me , and this time , she 's staring at me . oh , my god .
look , when i was a young member , i spent a lot of time to deal with the nuclear problem .
there was something that military scholars taught me that the military conflict is usually three cases , a strategic conflict , a strategic conflict .
each level , each conflict requires other kind of access and access models , other kind of organization .
it 's the same three cases that are the same , and most of us think it 's a national environment , and it 's also a local environment , and it 's also a local environment , in the midwest , in the midwest , in the midwest .
there 's a lot of troubles , but climate crisis is rare , strategic and strategic .
and everything is affected , and we need to act right here , and we need to act properly , preserve energy , efficiency , efficiency , and the global economies .
for us , we can use the resources and the political will , but it has to be the purpose of the resources for the resources .
i 'll show you this slide .
we 've had to start with the logo , of course , from the north pole .
by the end of the summer of greenland , it was at the end of the season ... of the mass of the season ... in the end of the jungle .
i went to the water center in this fall in the fall of the fall , and the oceans went to the intelligence center , and i spoke to the research center , and i had a conversation with the research of the research lab .
this is what happened in the last 28 years .
in the long eye , this is the record of 2005 .
it was the last time i had to worry about the research .
the north pole is the same size as geography , not the same size , but the size of the united states is the same size in the united states .
yang , the missing sheep in 2005 , east of the middle of the mississippi .
the extra sheep in the fall of the fall has come back in winter , but it 's not a permanent ice , but it 's ice .
and when it goes like this , green rand will feel a lot of pressure .
amy , in the arctic - this is a very famous town for alaska , which is the most recent town in alaska .
it 's a very serious area of a community that can only be very serious at the size of the year .
i 'd like to share two of the best stories of the earth , but it 's the same size , but it 's the same size .
there are carbon dioxide on the same exact planet .
but the other thing is , most of the carbon dioxide is on the atmosphere at the atmosphere at the atmosphere at the atmosphere , so most of the carbon dioxide is at 457 degrees celsius . we have a connection between strategy and strategy .
the jin palace is more closer to the sun .
now , we simply have a lot of images that you 've seen before , it 's one of the oldest images that remain at the sun , but the only reason to show you this is a simple csi .
it 's like this world warming up in the world of global warming , human warming , and this is a lot of infrared that we 're walking out of the earth .
you all know how certain it is to know that the government of the united nations is " 99 percent , " and they wanted to say " 99 percent . "
the chinese refused , but instead , " 90 % . "
now , they say , " wait a second , the amount of energy that comes from the cloth can change , " if this is true , there 's a lot of energy in the middle of the day .
if it 's a little bit more warm on the way out , it can be warmer and there 's the atmosphere in the lower side of the day .
this is the middle of the season , it 's so cool .
the climate .
there are 68 % of the good news now that there are 68 % of the humans that are responsible for global warming , which means global warming is still under the top of the list .
what you 're missing is lame .
now , in fact , if you do n't feel any analysis , but if you do n't feel the urgency , what are you talking about ?
i 'm carrying global testing on the world to create an ad to make this an ad for free and free care of a group of pro weather support .
that 's the winner .
i 'll show you the entire network of the entire network , and these are the top of the president 's candidates , and two of them are about to be part of the climate crisis .
two cnn .
this is one of the old tobacco ads .
this is what we 're doing .
it 's gasoline in all of this country and we 're here .
but it 's not just the enemy .
they are following us now , and it 's slowing down , and virtually , the most basic release of the year of this year is our belief that we are going to follow in the year of 2065 .
if rich countries are completely gone from this picture , we 're still going through this crisis .
but we 've developed this crisis and an accident , and it 's created a crisis , this is bolivian , for 30 years .
this is only a few seconds , and it 's 60 years old .
it 's good news that we can stop here in ' 90s , and that 's good news .
we have skills .
the war against the poor of the world and the richest countries of the world , we must have a single perspective about how to solve this problem .
they say , " what 's the solution ? " right here .
we 'll have to replace the face of the carbon dioxide , and we have to replace the tax from the face of the bismarck , and it has changed several things since the nineteenth century .
in the poor world , we must be able to maintain the answer to the poor , the solution to the poor .
the plan to fight the poor is if we do n't solve the climate crisis .
but in the poor country , they actually make a difference .
this is what you brought from the magazine magazine , and this is the power of the solar panels , the solar implant , the original energy plant from europe , and all of the power in europe .
this is not a painting , it can happen .
we need to do this for our own economic economic system .
you will have a lot of speculation that you can get your portfolio and blood , if you invest in your immunity or blood .
this is based on a model model .
it 's like a bunch of fools , when their arms and legs are collapsing when the vessels collapse from their feet , and it 's the same thing that i deem personal .
i 've invested in this , and i 'm going to have to write it down .
ten , the solar flare , the latest sun cells , efficiency and efficiency .
you 've seen this slide before , but there 's something different .
now , the only country that 's not empty is now a vote .
in australia , in australia , we 've been in a campaign containing television , including tv , radio commercials , radios .
we 've trained 250 people in every village in australia and cities in the city to show us 250 people .
many other things have been published , and the prime minister has announced that the priority is to change the title of australia , which is actually a part of a horrible drought that they 've been through .
culins culins are if the drought calls us names , so the southeast drought will call it katrina , which is on the way to atlanta .
australia had to change political culture .
i 've got a better announcement ... in the u.s. of the city of the united states .
i think i 've seen the person who went to the place to promote this , and i think it 's good news .
a few days ago , we heard about the value of privacy , so it 's so common that now that it became a cliché .
what we need is another hero generation , not only in the united states , but all the people in the world have to understand how it 's going to happen to us .
now we have a distraction .
but we have an emergent situation on earth .
and we need to find a way to create this generation to create a generation of generations to create today .
i 'd like to hear the word that i can tell you .
they were another hero in the world who brought democracy to earth .
another generation has granted the slaves of slavery and the women of the women .
we can do that , do n't tell us that we do n't have the ability .
even a week for us to spend a week on the iraqi war , we 'll be able to solve this problem .
we have the ability to do that .
the last thing i want to tell you is that i 'm optimistic that i 'm optimistic , and i believe that the distractions of the history of this vast challenge is that i believe that history has the ability to stand up to challenge us .
" oh , it 's awful . "
" i 'd like to ask you to look at you on another angle , how many generations have you had to stand up for the best of your best efforts in the history of mankind ?
we think we should be grateful that we thank the generation of the generation that we can be grateful for the generation of the generation and the people and the artists of the future and the acts of bright and optimistic and optimistic and optimistic and optimistic . they were the ones who found their ability inside their inside .
let 's do that . thank you very much .
chris anderson , there 's a lot of people in this huge amount of pain , which is basically the design of the voting bill for the last eight years .
i 'm sorry .
you do n't know what the candidates are doing , chris anderson , who are ahead of the candidates for global warming , do you like the idea of global warming ?
because it 's hard to answer the question because on one side , we have two candidates , and both of us , we have two candidates to be very excited about each other , and all three of them are being taken , and the three of them have given the best leader of the world . all three people , they think they 're planning plans and offer , and they think it 's responsible , but the nature of the natural preservation plant is not the same .
as a matter of question and the answer to the campaign , as the answer to the campaign , all these debate , has been received by a group named george orcoal name .
one of the discussion was sponsored by a support of amcoal coal .
" now , the bulk of the ashes are more extensive ! "
the price of our democracy and the complete and absolute perfection is not the most powerful kind of bolder of the bolder .
people are saying the right thing , and whoever wins or who gets elected , and when i come back to the senator in 1997 , there 's only one person that gave it to me , and when i came back to the senate , there was only one person who gave it to me . whatever the nominations say , we have to be able to do it with what they say .
this challenge is part of our civilization all of our civilization .
the co2 is literally the breathing of our civilization .
we now try to reverse that process , change the patterns and the scale of the pattern beyond the past .
it is exactly the reason that i 'm very optimistic about what you 're doing to be a citizen of what i do .
to be an active citizen , there 's a lot of power to change , but it needs to change the lightbulb .
we need to rise up and solve this democracy , our democracy is tense , and we must change it .
use the internet . access to the internet .
i want you to meet the people , become a civil citizen .
we do n't have a new range of electricity to store the carbon dioxide , which we ca n't store the carbon dioxide .
right now , no one 's talking about this , but i believe it 's possible before november .
in allies for this climate support , we 're trying to get a national campaign , a television commercial , the internet commercial , the media , the media and the media .
we need help .
well , what about the fact that it 's a personal part of being a person to move forward , chris anderson , something bigger than you want to do ?
i pray you can find the answer to that question .
" the berkster fuller has written this once , " if all human future depends on me , what am i gonna do ?
" it depends on all of us , once again , once again , and it 's not just changing the lightbulb . "
most of us are american , we have democracy .
we can change the situation , but we need to change it .
what you really need is the highest level of self .
it will be hard to make , but i will .
you know , there are some people who know you , but the old african saying , " go alone , you go alone , you go alone . "
so we have to change consciousness .
you have to change your promise .
we have to thank the privilege of taking responsibility for this challenge .
uncle chris anderson , thank you very much for coming to ted .
thank you very much .
anyway , this song is an evil song about science .
there 's a man who 's worth the walk next to me , so when i walk on the streets , someone 's on the phone , and i 'm not alone , so i 'm not alone . if you and i can get through anything , you and i will stay together , but do n't pretend that we 're staying together , do n't pretend that nature is not a fake .
it 's rich , but nobody lives with me , so nobody lives with me . let 's show it that the love of our cancer is more beautiful than the old phil parker , who will live with us instead of the old phil parker .
" oh , my god , i love you so much . "
" i 'm the only person i ever loved . "
oh , that 's the chief , and i think you 're adorable .
-lrb- applause -rrb- hello , everyone .
we 're here to show you the land of the park .
i am now off one of robert lang 's model .
now , i 'm gonna make this piece of paper that i 'm holding , and you see the wrinkled wrinkled i need here ?
and rufus 's gonna have to improvise the next five days , and he 's gonna play his music , and that 's awesome .
all right , you ready ?
i 'll cover my eyes for a little more fun .
all right , rufus , let 's get started .
okay , here we go .
-lrb- applause -rrb- it was hard to understand the population positive when i arrived in a beautiful jibabrisk .
i 've come to visit people 's homes , to understand the death of the plague .
for that , this photo is the one with the hubert and his grandmother .
when i first saw herbert , he was sitting on her knee .
herbert became an orphan , and he was an orphan for aids until he died with aids .
herbert loved to sit on grandma 's lap because she was sick because she was lying in her bed .
i felt that my grandmother woke up to boil the car and hand him over to my knee .
i asked hubert not to need anything before he left his house .
i thought the kid would ask for doll or candy , but the baby asked me for slippers .
this is joyce joyce . she 's 21 years old .
she was a moody , and aids positive .
i took her picture into a picture of her , beautiful little girl , before she was born .
last week , when i was walking in manhattan , i received a phone call from a woman who did n't know that joyce died , she was 23 .
joyce 's mother is taking care of her daughter , just like the other kids in zimbabean .
this is what i 'm talking about .
but every picture has a life story that 's worth enough .
all these photos were taken in the babacaster .
christine , can you let me talk to you about how you got to africa ?
um ...
you can make it easy , actually , as a fashion photographer at the time .
and then i 've been reading the new york times , and i 've seen the stats on the charts , and i 'm surprised .
it was very traumatic .
so i stopped working , and i decided to do what i wanted .
at first , they sent me a month and a month ago , and then i spent a month in the babazoware in a month , and then i went back to march for a month .
thank you .
thank you for your opportunity .
just like the cromberlake , one of the way to change our dna is to create a new gene .
another way is to change our lives in life .
i 've been able to find out how many changes these changes are through the study , and how short time it works .
and if you eat a good meal , you deal with stress , you work with the stress and the love , your brain gets more than your blood and oxygen supply .
it 's not just the size of the brain , but the size of the brain .
a few years ago , the things that were considered impossible to be considered is a new level of shame , so it 's a new one .
but , actually , the actor , robin williams has mentioned the same thing a few years ago .
there are many things you can do to create new brain cells .
i like the best thing in my heart , cars , blueberry , traces of alcohol , and marijuana it 's found in marijuana .
i did n't do it myself . they just said it .
what were you talking about ?
and on the other hand , there are some active activity to kill the brain cells .
it 's mostly called fire fat , sugar , optine , alcohol , alcohol , alcohol , and chronic stress .
in a regular life , your skin will have more blood and more skin wrinkled and older .
not only the skin has blood supply in your heart .
because it could actually turn back the heart disease .
the artery on the left , the artery on the left is getting better in the eyes for a year .
if you see the little pet-t scan under the left , the blue means no blue supply .
just a year later , there 's orange and white , and there 's more of orange and white .
to change the evolution of breast cancer or the high line of breast cancer , or to improve breast cancer , improve the condition of the cancer .
the 70 % of the experiments in the lab who changed the cancer cells , the 70 % of the culture is just nine percent of the culture , but only nine percent of the culture are contained .
this is a big difference .
and your ability to increase your blood for more than yours .
one of the most effective smoking of the smoking was to show you the cause of a bobo , but it revealed the possibility of a heart disease , but not only the result of a heart disease .
there 's an erection about half half of the intake .
definitely effective advertising .
now we 're preparing to announce that our genetic cancer patients can change their prostate function patient .
this is a hit map , and all the other colors that you see on the right is a different gene .
we 've been able to observe that more than 500 more sources are better and better , good genes , and the dna that 's causing the disease is being activated .
these discovery believe that many people are willing to give hope to a lot of hope and choices .
and some companies are able to provide a gene profile for their clients , so some of them are my genetic profile .
the gene does not decide our fate , of course , of course , the gene is in our natural nature , but if we do n't do it , we can influence the gene to the way the gene is .
thank you .
i spoke to the design of design four years ago .
at the end of the story , i showed you a list of names .
we still have n't learned anything about it since then .
this is a huge monkey who 's been built to the scottish city . " everyone thinks they 're right all the time . "
it 's like the sum of the triche is the sum of it .
" the pills are fun at first , but then it becomes jim . "
we 're using a change of change .
this is footage of the gallery , people passing through .
we tear the cobwebs away .
all this is part of the graphic design .
we design for our customers .
these are the clients who hired a client .
i would never spend money for my money , or i do n't spend the money to produce , so there 's always a customer in the works .
we 've installed $ 65,000 on a road full of clothing shop .
" do n't worry about anything . "
at first , i went to the magazine on two sides of two sides .
the print company lost his file , but he did n't tell us .
when i was in a magazine , it was 12 pages .
" the money would make me really happy . "
so i felt sorry for the fact that my friend in austria told the great casino owner of lintz 's largest casino , so i could cover his building .
this is lintz 's big voter road .
on the front of the building , " money " says " money " does n't make me happy . "
there was a show last week in new york .
and since we 've been through the window , the other designer comes to another designer , and they have a picture of what they 've learned from a window that they 've learned .
everyone was involved - dr . milton mamagt .
the song was paul 's subject for quite a long time .
this is a small place we 're filming , a giant , giant astrolotron .
the only reason i care about this project is that a little normal , a little more profound , and more profound things that have brought me from my journal .
i often see what i wanted from my journal and what i wanted to change .
if you want a long time , i 'm actually doing something about it .
the last one is an advertisement .
this is the roof of new york 's studio .
there 's her room and her hand on top of her .
we 're going to have our backs and stenties under the sun .
as you know , the glass is quite yellow under the sun .
a week later , we took the leaves and the leaves , and the sun came down to the center of the day , so it 's been used , and it 's been written by the first day of the day .
after three days , the work was gone , and then a week later , i was n't complaining anymore .
thank you .
50 years ago in the soviet engineers have begun a great job in the barren country of the countryside .
they hope to capture all the world 's minds to conquer the universe for the first time in the world .
the rocket is huge .
and then the front of the rocket was rigged with a ball made of two radios in the front of the rocket .
rocket has launched a rocket at october 4 , 1957 .
a russian scientist will call us a new planet at the time .
they were able to find land that were n't found by the time they were found in the past and columbus .
now we become the hero of the universe .
now our descendants will be envious of our joy . "
you 're looking at part of my fifth artwork , but it 's not finished yet .
this is the story of snik 's history , and they hear stories about what 's happening in america .
for the launch , a vamanik has made a lot of questions .
regular citizens were supposed to be in possession of the artificial moon , and this is a lot of people , and now they 're pride and pride , and they 're so proud of what they 're shooting in the universe .
but after the launch of the red monday , it was proof that the media and politicians were defeated by science and technology , and now they believe that they can use a hydrogen bomb .
after that announcement , the board has been all messed up .
they are one of the three hits in america , so they believe this case is like pearl harbor or 9/11 .
stk was caused by a potential dose of explosives .
there was a military race that started .
there 's been a space competition .
in a few years , congress has been able to extend the power of mass destruction of mass destruction , but in the case of a nuclear weapon , we 've done £ 1,200 and increase .
and the reaction to the fatnik is beyond military increase .
like , some of the men who are here will remember the world of ' 78 and tens of thousands of people who were evacuated in ' 78 to the basement of ' 78 .
or in caleb 's investigation , seven americans will have a nuclear war , and at least 50 % of the population did n't kill .
but they also make a positive change of positive changes .
like , some of the students went back to several schools by a few schools .
engineering , maths , science -
not only , according to a vf , it 's called a pa , and it 's affecting the birth of pa , and the birth of nasa itself .
my own documentary says that the media can move on to the board itself .
but we 've been dealing with things that we 've been doing so bad about how bad it is to the united states to the united states .
" putnik " is about to be released soon .
first , i 'd like to say thank you for your gratitude to the jay walker , the old lannisters .
and i am grateful for all of you who are here .
-lrb- applause -rrb-
chris , thank you .
i 'm studying the physics of physics .
in fact , it was the physics of physics .
one of them is a relationship between the language of a distance .
the expertise between the united states and west europe linguists ...
a relationship between far away from the distance is to turn it back into one big , far farther away than the izoku .
the linguists do n't like it , they 're weird , but i think it 's different .
there are genius linguists in the russian institute , usually at the institute of the institute , which is really looking forward to them .
what if all the languages are from one prototype ... and then two years ago ?
if that was before , would it be a competition with the primordial ?
how long do we have to go back to this ?
how deep is the history of modern languages ?
what 's the conclusion of the consequences ?
you know , i think the history of modern language ... the history of the modern languages , a piece of dancing , a piece of dancing ... a lot longer than the same thing .
if you could do that , you would have a modern language .
that 's why i 'm guessing at least .
but most of the languages , most of them , they can also assume the same language in the epimes , which is also a matter of a two-year single language .
looks like the phillips anderson is right .
i mean , all the people in the world ...
thank you .
-lrb- applause -rrb-
thank you .
now , there 's one picture , where are we ?
this is our home , where i live .
which country is it ?
yes , she 's a skinny young man .
is he 19 now ?
yeah , i 'm 19 now .
what was your idea ?
i wanted a rider .
it 's a prototype .
yeah .
well , what was it for ?
yeah .
so what did you do with it ?
school quit , went to the library , and i read the book , and i got some information about creating energy .
and then it worked .
so , literally , the plans that are in the book are still following the blueprints .
uh , no , i ... what did i do ?
in fact , there are three of the people in the book , no , i have three , no , i have three , i made the wings .
a book of the book is three wings , four wings that you built ?
yeah .
what do you mean , " c " for what ?
i made a pair of wings because i want big power .
right .
yeah .
did you know that your dog was better ?
yes , test .
and what did you use ?
so , what ingredients did you use ?
bicycle frame , pulley pipe , and used a plastic pipe , and , uh , can you show me the next slide ?
yeah , that 's the height .
so , how does the car work ?
if the wind blows , the heat will turn and power .
how much electricity do we have ?
w ... 12 watts .
so , how many times have you turned out the light that 's in the house ?
i 've got four of the lightbulb .
that 's amazing .
yeah .
c ... and the next picture , please ?
it 's my parents who bought the radio .
so my parents saw what you made when you were 15 and 15 and 15 , and you were impressed ?
yeah .
so , what are you gonna do with this ?
i mean , i 'm asking you if you want to make more tea .
yeah , i 'd like to make something else , for the crops , to the crops .
you 're gonna be taller than this , right ?
yeah .
how big ?
you should be able to make more and more than 20 watts .
could the whole town take water for the whole town ?
yeah .
that 's why you want to help someone who can help you build that dream in the ted room ?
uh , if anyone can help ... the ingredients , yes .
it 's still 19 years old , but you think you 're doing the future of the future ... and you 're doing what you 're doing ?
yes , i have something to do with the energy .
it 's an honor to invite you to the ted .
thank you so much for coming .
thank you .
